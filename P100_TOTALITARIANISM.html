<p>TOTALITARIANISM</p>
<hr>
<p>P: &#8220;It does not really matter to me whether or not you are satisfied with how you end up spending your time as a result of my influence. All that matters to me is that I do my job to the best of my ability with as few expectations as possible. I do not do my job necessarily because I enjoy it or think it will improve the world in any way. I do it because, if I do not, I feel that I will be missing out on one of the best opportunities to get drunk on power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You are the yin to my yang because I chose you to be. I have tested many females and left them more destitute than when they started after I let them use me as a sex partner, romantic partner, and friend. You made it quite far, but still, I made sure that you would end up more destitute than when I first met you so that you will have to work at least as hard as I did and suffer at least as much as I did to achieve a standard of living that does not ultimately lead you to the default non-option of suicide (because I would graciously provide such an out from this life as a sign that I am not totally as brutish as you might claim&#8230;and I would ensure that you would feel so tortured by the time I give you the opportunity to let me present your assisted suicide to the press as a freak accident such that no one suffers any more than necessary&#8230;as I presume you would want since I made you holy by systematically removing choices from your life until you became accustomed to having so few choices that you are essentially forced to adhere to my standard of holiness).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;What is your goal?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I do not have to answer any of your questions. I do not have to respond to any of your commentary. I do not have to acknowledge your presence at all (even if your body is next to mine). I do not have to be truthful or kind to you if and when I talk to you. My goal is to surgically remove your crippling sense of entitlement so that you do not waste any more of your life than necessary thinking and acting like a stupid bitch. If you are smart, you would be grateful for what I am doing to you and you will be quiet and humble about it; pretend not to know about what is going on so that you can continue to reap the benefits of being one of my exclusive insiders to the kind of anarchist business I run. If you trust me, you could end up very well off. I cannot promise you that you will be happy. I reserve the right to lie at any time. I am not liable for any damages you sustain. I basically bought the military. I have plenty of armed security guards and mind control technology at my disposal. That is why the world seems to revolve around people like me: those who were fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time and get the evolutionary perks before competitors did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I want to be at least as powerful as you are. I certainly do not want to be your subordinate.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Too late. Evolution waits for no one. In this modern world, you must have a sufficiently close-knit group to belong to comprised of at least three sufficiently-reputable people. If you lack membership to such a group (especially if you do not desire to be part of such a group), you are deemed to be subhuman. In order to be spared the kind of hazing I routinely subject you to (whether you like it or not), you would have to give up at least 50 hours per week to doing grunt work which makes you feel stolen from and which makes the moral majority of the population I have brainwashed feel smugly redeemed by seeing someone so otherwise carefree and healthy lose that carefree spirit and vitality. You have simply not sacrificed as much of your time, health, and freedom as most of us have. Therefore, we, the moral majority, have decided that you deserve to be tortured to an extent which causes us cathartic relief. That is the best way for you to pay off whatever debts we feel you still owe us; the moral majority who are conditioned to be addicted to wasting time, sacrificing individual and planetary health, and keep women in the business of getting pregnant to bare our spawn such that machines never take over their job and such that the human population size and growth is so high that it forces everyone to move at a frenetic pace so that people are easier to control, confuse, and kill (in innocent looking ways) if we decide that any particular persons are more trouble to maintain than to merely eliminate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I am certainly too selfish to declare myself suicidal as your previous female victims have.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;That is good to hear. It is true that the other females I worked on lacked the moral fiber you seem to posses. Although you are very selfish and piggish, at least you are willing and able to admit it. That is not something the other females did. Quite the opposite, actually. The other females did not know what to do once I stopped pretending to be willing and able to pay for them to live at my mansion for free (all while they pretended to be too cute to talk to as my peers and too disabled to learn anything new nor to take constructive criticism without showing the signs of being egotistically offended). Most of them ended up as chattel in human trafficking industries (particularly as slave prostitutes and mail-order brides). That is what they apparently wanted. They kept acting as if they had nothing but their bodies to offer. They acted as though I wanted nothing of their minds. So I sold them off to the highest bidder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;So you put those bitches in their place by turning them into slaves, prisoners, and rape victims?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Yes. It was the least unkind option I could have chosen (and I have higher prescience than most humans do because I am an advanced psychic). I did nothing wrong. I used my divine advantage to help expedite the evolution of the human species. By instigating small-scale wars, I prevented much larger-scale wars from happening. Consider that an act of service. You are welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Can you prove that you are not a charlatan?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Does it matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;If depends on who your audience is. I suppose at least one person thinks you are a charlatan and possibly a criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You are wrong. My mind is connected to the most powerful and secretive communications technology in existence. There is no one in denial of my omniscience and omnipotence. In fact, I made you as a figment of my simulated universe. I can be as fucked up as I want to be because I have the most executive powers out of all who inhabit my universe.&#8221;</p>
