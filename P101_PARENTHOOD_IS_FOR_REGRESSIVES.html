PARENTHOOD_IS_FOR_REGRESSIVES

<hr>

It has been years since I have been able to simply focus on computer science (and apolitical subject matter in general) because, since I transferred from Chabot (Las Positas) College to California State University East Bay, an aggressively sex-obsessed, race-obsessed, populist, and (seemingly) manditory "curriculum" imposed itself on me until it literally ate my best job (i.e. my three-year internship as a Google Apps Script developer at Lawrence Berkeley Lab which apparently got defunded due to a change in management and gorvernmental priorities) and defunded what enabled me to get hired at my best job: the work-based learning curriculum formerly known as Las Positas Technical Support at Las Positas College (which was taken over by childcare instead according to the dictates of the wealthy school administrators). The message which seemed to be rearing its ugly head everywhere since 2012 is this: "information technology is a luxury; making more babies than the Earth can handle is not (because we will make sure that <span style="background:#ffff00;">the Earth has no choice but to go bankrupt on behalf of the limitless population growth of humans</span> which is spurred on by quaint religious mores which seem to imply that the default obligation of every sexually mature human is to have as many biological offspring as possible because STRENGTH IN NUMBERS beats intelligence every time. Hence, stupid people tend to contribute to overpopulation the most while smart people tend to have the fewest number of children (and the population average reflects the stupid people's priorities more so than the smartest (unless the children are wise enough to practice birth control and to not have any more offspring than they each can personally afford))."

Related to my complaint that there seems to be a "hidden in plain sight" pandemic of people who are in denial that they are being yelled at by voices beamed into their skulls through a relatively old technique known as <span style="background:#ffff00;">microwave auditory effect</span>. I bet that most people who hear such voices (and that may indeed be the majority of the United States population) are unable to distinguish between their own thoughts and the voices which are beamed in from an external source as subliminal propaganda. I bet that most people are too distracted by necessarily busy lifestyles spurred on by capitalism and oligarchy to notice such subtleties of "here and now" consciousness. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Having kids is one of the most effective ways there ever was to keep a human being too preoccupied with managing an unnecessary burden to do much to improve the quality of adult-level consciousness on Planet Earth.</span>

Finally, one last complaint before I drink my final two large cups of coffee and hit the road once again...

Each night I stayed in a motel recently, nearby "residents" (I like to pretend that we are a little temporary neighborhood of travelers) kept smoking cigarettes and burning petroleum right outside my window such that I was inhaling an unhealthy volume of toxic fumes. Sometimes I get the hunch that people are DELIBERATELY trying to pressure me to hurry up and publish something rather than to "procrastinate" by generating unnecessary levels of pollution in my vicinity (including noise pollution) in order to literally TORTURE me into looking good for the inexperienced (and daresay dumbed down) children who know nothing of the intricacies of how I practice my craft. I see that people who are far less competent than I am to do my job routinely act as thou it is their job to boss me around and to put me under a dysfunctional amount of stress and adverse health conditions. Such people are the reason why "most people" excuse themselves to be "not ready" to cut meat out of their diet, increase their physical exercise levels, increase their mental exercise levels, and abstain from the enterprise of marriage and procreation. <span style="background:#ffff00;">My hope is that, within my lifetime, the most popular way of procreating new human beings will be the programming of human stem cells from ideal gene templates which are incubated in artificial wombs for approximately nine months and then raised in government-run nurseries until those human beings are legal adults.</span>
