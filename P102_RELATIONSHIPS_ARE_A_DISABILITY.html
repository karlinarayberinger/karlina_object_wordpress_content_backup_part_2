<p>RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_A_DISABILITY</p>
<hr>
<p>As controversial as this may sound, I choose to adhere to the belief that most interpersonal (human) relationships (especially romantic ones) are a waste of my time.</p>
<p>For most of my life, almost all occasions of socializing felt forced, draining of my zest for life, and oppressive to my personal identity as a lifelong asocial person who has been hesitant to &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; as an asocial human being who rarely enjoys socializing and who prefers to only make money doing things that do not feel like being paid to socialize instead of solve problems alone.</p>
<p>For outing myself as an asocial introvert, I already know from ample experience that other people (the &#8220;moral majority&#8221; which is significantly more gregarious, familial, and conformist than I tend to be) will almost certainly resort to endlessly ridiculing me as &#8220;too selfish&#8221; to deserve happiness and mercy from the cruelty of other humans. Apparently, I hardly do &#8220;my fair share&#8221; of the imagined pot of undone and seemingly necessary communal labor (which mostly amounts to being a captive audience to some bore while pretending to not be irked about wasting time wallowing in another human&#8217;s lame clout bubble) such that I feel I have earned the right to thrive as optimally as I intend to. So, rather than wait for &#8220;the right&#8221; people to say &#8220;the right words&#8221; at &#8220;the right time&#8221; in order to make decisions of significance, I wait on other humans as little as necessary.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a consequence of not being more people-centric, I will be treated as less deserving of credit for my accomplishments than otherwise, less deserving of encouraging words than otherwise, and less deserving of attention than otherwise. That is a good thing because it means that I hardly need any input from other people to regulate my own clout bubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you care about is your clout bubble, website, body image, health, et cetera,&#8221; exclaim my critics. Of course, to them I am the eternal grinch; the stingy tight-wad who hardly does anything useful for anyone; that selfish leech of human civilization!</p>
<p>I do not mind insults as much as I mind being the victim of theft, violence, and rape. As an aspiring sage, I sincerely want to do my best to live happily unconditionally (although I will fight savagely to uphold my preferences and to not let other people &#8220;cheapen&#8221; my otherwise rich life).</p>
<p>Controversial Proposition: It is possible for a human to not enjoy being in close proximity to (or to &#8220;hang out&#8221; with) other humans despite being a member of an apparently social species (just as it is possible for a human to be gay even though most humans are heterosexual).</p>
<p>I personally get irritated when I think other humans are trying to force me to pay more attention to them than I want to (unless it is for a legitimate emergency). I do my best to not communicate my irritability, but it has a way of making itself known.</p>
<p>As controversial as this may sound, the more other people use aggressively coercive tactics to make me pay attention to them (and to give them the reaction they want), the less I tend to want to give such people my attention. I do my best to tolerate it with a tranquil demeanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be humble in our midst. Speak only when necessary. Do not look irritable. Smile! Otherwise, we will steal from you or try to interfere with your livelihood in order to train you to be more like how we want you to be,&#8221; say my imaginary (and not so imaginary) critics.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will not socialize the way we want you to, then you deserve to be cut off from all forms of communication until you learn to beg for companionship and human kindness,&#8221; say my imaginary (and not so imaginary) critics.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I get all the socialization I need just by going about my life as a digital nomad.</span> I do not feel lonely. I simply prefer to be alone at least 90% of the time. I do not need to be part of some special meet-up group to feel like a productive member of society. What I am devoting most of my time to is adapting to the post-coronavirus world such that I can have as much freedom to do what I actually enjoy while I have the chance.</p>
<p>What about serving humanity? What about saving the ecosystem so that humanity can live for another thousand years at least? What about helping to implement a better economic system and sustainable energy infrastructure? I will do the best I can to help contribute to making human civilization more enjoyable for everyone (especially as time moves forward). Right now, there is not much I can do other than research, develop, and keep playing life as a game.</p>
