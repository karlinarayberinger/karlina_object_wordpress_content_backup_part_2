RELATIONSHIPS_ARE_A_DISABILITY

<hr>

As controversial as this may sound, I choose to adhere to the belief that most interpersonal (human) relationships (especially romantic ones) are a waste of my time. 

For most of my life, almost all occasions of socializing felt forced, draining of my zest for life, and oppressive to my personal identity as a lifelong asocial person who has been hesitant to "come out of the closet" as an asocial human being who rarely enjoys socializing and who prefers to only make money doing things that do not feel like being paid to socialize instead of solve problems alone.

For outing myself as an asocial introvert, I already know from ample experience that other people (the "moral majority" which is significantly more gregarious, familial, and conformist than I tend to be) will almost certainly resort to endlessly ridiculing me as "too selfish" to deserve happiness and mercy from the cruelty of other humans. Apparently, I hardly do "my fair share" of the imagined pot of undone and seemingly necessary communal labor (which mostly amounts to being a captive audience to some bore while pretending to not be irked about wasting time wallowing in another human's lame clout bubble) such that I feel I have earned the right to thrive as optimally as I intend to. So, rather than wait for "the right" people to say "the right words" at "the right time" in order to make decisions of significance, I wait on other humans as little as necessary.

I understand that, as a consequence of not being more people-centric, I will be treated as less deserving of credit for my accomplishments than otherwise, less deserving of encouraging words than otherwise, and less deserving of attention than otherwise. That is a good thing because it means that I hardly need any input from other people to regulate my own clout bubble.

"All you care about is your clout bubble, website, body image, health, et cetera," exclaim my critics. Of course, to them I am the eternal grinch; the stingy tight-wad who hardly does anything useful for anyone; that selfish leech of human civilization! 

I do not mind insults as much as I mind being the victim of theft, violence, and rape. As an aspiring sage, I sincerely want to do my best to live happily unconditionally (although I will fight savagely to uphold my preferences and to not let other people "cheapen" my otherwise rich life).
