<p>CROSSING_ASYMPTOTES</p>
<hr>
<p>In the spring of 2016 (the year in which I was committed to a psychiatric hospital for the first time (because I went temporarily &#8220;manic&#8221; and felt that I could invincibly and tirelessly travel by foot from the San Francisco Bay Area to some &#8220;happily ever after&#8221; destination in Oregon) and &#8220;initiated&#8221; into an &#8220;invisible gang&#8221; of fellow seekers of truth and inspiration (especially via the power of psychedelics)), I did something which may have catapulted me from &#8220;normal cowardice&#8221; into a state of being willing to die at any moment as a result of taking a secret oath between myself and God (and do not forget that I am both an atheist and a pantheist).</p>
<p>After being saturated with TetraHydroCannabinol (THC) from consuming relatively large quantities of cannabis edibles across a period of about six months, I was living in a world which was awash with luminescence permeating the spaces around me as beautifully as the morning sunlight through the green leaves at Garin Park (where I started hanging out by myself in my family&#8217;s (petroleum powered) automobile between classes at California State University East Bay in Hayward to smoke weed out of a bong, eat chocolate blueberry edibles from a can, suck on cannabis vapors from a USB-powered vape pen, and, perhaps most embarrassingly, read from a paperback copy of the Holy Bible New International Version). During that time, I knew that I was wracking up debt much faster than I could pay it off (especially since I lost my job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab after the Information Technology Collaborative Services department in which I worked apparently got defunded out of existence in late 2015). I knew that I only had a few months to live as lavishly and as unrestrictedly as I was; so I spent money, time, and energy as though I already intuitively knew that the next five years would be akin to (legal) slavery and covert gang initiations (and my predictions were quite accurate and timely).</p>
<p>During the spring of 2016, I took special note of the following passages out of a 2011 copy of the Holy (Christian) Bible New International Version (an English translation of the Bible first published in 1978 by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society)):</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>John 3:1-36</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[4] “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”</p>
<p>[5] Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.</p>
<p>[6] Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.</p>
<p>[7] You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’</p>
<p>[8] The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>John 7:1-53</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[16] Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.</p>
<p>[17] Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</p>
<p>[18] Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</p>
<p>[19] Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”</p>
<p>[20] “You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>John 14:1-31</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[15] “If you love me, keep my commands.</p>
<p>[16] And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—</p>
<p>[17] the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.</p>
<p>[18] I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.</p>
<p>[19] Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.</p>
<p>[20] On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.</p>
<p>[21] Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.”</p>
<p>[22] Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”</p>
<p>[23] Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.</p>
<p>[24] Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>1 John 4:1-21</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[7] Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.</p>
<p>[8] Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.</p>
<p>[9] This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.</p>
<p>[10] This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p>
<p>[11] Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</p>
<p>[12] No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.</p>
<p>[13] This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.</p>
<p>[14] And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>[15] If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.</p>
<p>[16] And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.</p>
<p>[17] This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.</p>
<p>[18] There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.</p>

<pre>Let X be any real number quantity except for zero.

Let F be a function which takes exactly one instance of X as input and which returns (1 / X) as the output.

Let Y be the the output of F(X).

// Then Y is some real number quantity which is not zero and whose absolute value is no larger than one.

<p>The pseudocode above constructs the inverse of x function, a mathematical function I find particularly beautiful in its symmetry and ability to map infinite quantities separated by asymptotic values. On a more &#8220;spiritual&#8221; level, such a function is a metaphor of parallel universes and how they exist inside of one multiverse even if it is impossible for an object in one universe to travel to another universe without undergoing some extreme matter-energy transformation such as decaying into pure energy after being ripped apart by the acceleration of gravity&#8217;s pull. It makes me wonder whether or not physical (and not just purely mathematical) asymptotes exist which enable a person to cross some &#8220;event horizon&#8221; without losing personal continuity of consciousness.</p>
