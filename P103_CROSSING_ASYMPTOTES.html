CROSSING_ASYMPTOTES

<hr>

In the spring of 2016 (the year in which I was committed to a psychiatric hospital for the first time (because I went temporarily "manic" and felt that I could invicibly and tirelessly travel by foot from the San Francisco Bay Area to some "happily ever after" destination in Oregon) and "initiated" into an "invisible gang" of fellow seekers of truth and inpiration (especially via the power of psychedelics)), I did something which may have catapulted me from "normal cowardice" into a state of being willing to die at any moment as a result of taking a secret oath between myself and God (and do not forget that I am both an atheist and a pantheist).

After being saturated with TetraHydroCannabinol (THC) from consuming relatively large quantites of cannabis edibles across a period of about six months, I was living in a world which was awash with luminescense permeating the spaces around me as beautifully as the morning sunlight through the green leaves at Garin Park (where I started hanging out by myself in my family's (petroleum powered) automobile between classes at California State University East Bay in Hayward to smoke weed out of a bong, eat chocolate blueberry edibles from a can, suck on cannabis vapors from a USB-powered vape pen, and, perhaps most embarassingly, read from a paperback copy of the Holy Bible New International Version). During that time, I knew that I was wracking up debt much faster than I could pay it off (especially since I lost my job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab after the Information Technology Collaborative Services department in which I worked apparently got defunded out of existence in late 2015). I knew that I only had a few months to live as lavishly and as unrestrictedly as I was; so I spent money, time, and energy as though I already intuitively knew that the next five years would be akin to (legal) slavery and covert gang initiations (and my predictions were quite accurate and timely).
