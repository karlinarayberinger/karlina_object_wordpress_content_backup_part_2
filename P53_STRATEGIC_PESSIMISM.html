STRATEGIC_PESSIMISM

<hr>

<span style="background:#ffff00;">I now am convinced that erroring on the side of pessimisn instead of optimism is a much more pragmatic way to handle uncertainty and suffering than is erroring on the side of optimism.</span>

A pattern I have noticed since 2016 was that I felt more stalked by some stealth anonymous agent(s) than ever before (and I noticed how civillians (including young children) seemed to clamour for my attention (both in public and in places were a desire for privacy would normally be honored) while those children and their preachy, chauninist parents would make antagonistic remarks at me as though I were some kind of Disney villain mascot who was created in some government laboratory for the amusement of sheltered, brainwashed "family first" civillians (and deserving of chronic bullying from the masses as punishment for running away from home and for not making romance (especially the heterosexual variety) and motherhood the center of my life to the exclusion of what I would otherwise want my life to be: absolute freedom to remain single, childless, celibate, limitlessly ambitious, limitlessly creative, and simply happy on my own rather than pining for interpersonal relationships with other human puggy pig apes)).

Even more significant to me is the pattern which I have just now started coming to terms with (this year): <span style="background:#ffff00;">the more time, effort, and enthusiasm I invest in a creative or intellectual project, the more the human-controlled aspects of my environment seem to deliberately conspire against such efforts.</span> 

It is almost as if the (human) universe were trying to trick me into thinking that some (superhuman) "divine intervention" from some almighty, anthropocentric, androcentric God were raining down invisible torrents of malice upon me as "punishment" for my refusal to be as meek and as insecure as "His chosen people" seem to want me to be. In other words, it seems that the military-industrial complex which pervades the country I live in is driven by subliminal propaganda which terrorizes people into thinking and behaving like politically conservative sheep (i.e. anti-ecologically conscientuous, anti-egalitarian relationships between men and women, covertly mandatory impregnation of fertile women, anti-psychedelics, anti-science, and blind faith-driven passengers on some modern Noah's Arc).

Perhaps I seem to get disproportionately more hostility from the anonymous though police than most other people do because I have been "blessed" with more diverse experiences, innate advantages, and fortunate circumstances than the average citizen does. Therefore, I am considered to be a billionaire in terms of my quality of life who "deserves" to be robbed of material possessions, communication channels, privacy, and even my own memories by some "Robin Hood" whose job is to "fight socioeconomic ineqality" by disenfranchising the rich in order to appease the retributive cravings of the poor.

I am not a fan of retribution because it goes against my lightweight, logically airtight code of ethics (see TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY for details). In particular, retribution (i.e. the fallacious argument which says "If X does something which causes Y to feel hurt, then Y is obliged to inflict at least as much hurt on X in order to discourage X from doing what which causes Y to feel hurt (and X deserves to hurt more than Y does because X was allegedly the instigator of some crime"
