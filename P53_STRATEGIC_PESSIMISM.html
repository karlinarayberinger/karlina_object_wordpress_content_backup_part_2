STRATEGIC_PESSIMISM

<hr>

<span style="background:#ffff00;">I now am convinced that erroring on the side of pessimisn instead of optimism is a much more pragmatic way to handle uncertainty and suffering than is erroring on the side of optimism.</span>

A pattern I have noticed since 2016 was that I felt more stalked by some stealth anonymous agent(s) than ever before (and I noticed how civillians (including young children) seemed to clamour for my attention (both in public and in places were a desire for privacy would normally be honored) while those children and their preachy, chauninist parents would make antagonistic remarks at me as though I were some kind of Disney villain mascot who was created in some government laboratory for the amusement of sheltered, brainwashed "family first" civillians (and deserving of chronic bullying from the masses as punishment for running away from home and for not making romance (especially the heterosexual variety) and motherhood the center of my life to the exclusion of what I would otherwise want my life to be: absolute freedom to remain single, childless, celibate, limitlessly ambitious, limitlessly creative, and simply happy on my own rather than pining for interpersonal relationships with other human puggy pig apes)).

Even more significant to me is the pattern which I have just now started coming to terms with (this year): <span style="background:#ffff00;">the more time, effort, and enthusiasm I invest in a creative or intellectual project, the more the human-controlled aspects of my environment seem to deliberately conspire against such efforts.</span> 

It is almost as if the (human) universe were trying to trick me into thinking that some (superhuman) "divine intervention" from some almighty, anthropocentric, androcentric God were raining down invisible torrents of malice upon me as "punishment" for my refusal to be as meek and as insecure as "His chosen people" seem to want me to be. In other words, it seems that the military-industrial complex which pervades the country I live in is driven by subliminal propaganda which terrorizes people into thinking and behaving like politically conservative sheep (i.e. anti-ecologically conscientuous, anti-egalitarian relationships between men and women, covertly mandatory impregnation of fertile women, anti-psychedelics, anti-science, and blind faith-driven passengers on some modern Noah's Arc).

Perhaps I seem to get disproportionately more hostility from the anonymous though police than most other people do because I have been "blessed" with more diverse experiences, innate advantages, and fortunate circumstances than the average citizen does. Therefore, I am considered to be a billionaire in terms of my quality of life who "deserves" to be robbed of material possessions, communication channels, privacy, and even my own memories by some "Robin Hood" whose job is to "fight socioeconomic ineqality" by disenfranchising the rich in order to appease the retributive cravings of the poor.

I am not a fan of retribution because it goes against my lightweight, logically airtight code of ethics (see <span style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY</span> for details). In particular, retribution (i.e. the emotion-driven argument which says <span style="background:#ffff00;">"If X does something which causes Y to feel hurt, then Y is obliged to inflict at least as much hurt on X in order to discourage X from doing that which causes Y to feel hurt (and X deserves to hurt more than Y does because X was allegedly the instigator of some crime to which Y was the innocent victim)."</span>

Perhaps this has something to do with John George Psychiatric Pavilion and what happened in early 2016...

Rather than prepare (and show up) for my final exams during my senior year as an undergraduate student of computer science at California State Universiy East Bay in the winter of 2016, I decided to take an escapist solitary road trip to Yosemite National Park in order to escape what felt like prison walls closing in around me the closer I got to graduation.

While sitting in the Raley's grocery store parking lot in Merced (California), my tentative boyfriend expressed his disapproval of my taking extravagant solitary vactions and threatened to jump in front of a train to commit suicide after I spewed insults at him (all via telecommunications, of course). 

My "crime" was calling 911 to report that person's stated intent to commit suicide (and I was not as stoic as I should have been). I should have not even bothered to intervene in that person's life at all from that point on.

As a result of my calling the police to report what superficially sounded like a planned suicide, that person was abducted by emergency medical crew and carted over to John George Psychiatric Pavalion to be evaluated for less than a day. He was released on the basis of being normal. 

Months later, I ended up being lead by subtle clues to a different psychiatric hospital in San Francisco after that person officially dumped me on 20_APRIL_2016. I was locked up for a week, forced to take mood stabilizer medication against my will, and treated as less worthy of being taken seriously than was my ex. That goes to show that my ex probably gets favorable treatment compared to what I get on the basis that he is (and was) more popular than me, is (and was) more culturally conventional than me, and is (and was) more established as a white collar professional than me.

Over the past years, I have seen other people almost always take his side against me and behave in ways which seemed designed to make me feel excluded from his house parties, special interest groups, and even honest and timely communication. 

Whether I complain (or not), I always seem to get attacked by people who seem to think that I deserve to be treated as the devilish foil to his angelic stature. What is most notable to me is how, whenever I finally get juiced up and ready to code, that's when I get interupted by hackers, theives, and bullies the most.

To this day I have yet to see anyone (even cyber cops, family members, and former friends/acquaintances take a stand for me). What I think is going on is that he (and most other people) are not happy with the idea of me making lots of money without suffering at least as much as he did (since he apparently went to extremes to claw his way out of destitute and hostile circumstances).
