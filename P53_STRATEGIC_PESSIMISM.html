STRATEGIC_PESSIMISM

<hr>

<span style="background:#ffff00;">I now am convinced that erroring on the side of pessimisn instead of optimism is a much more pragmatic way to handle uncertainty and suffering than is erroring on the side of optimism.</span>

A pattern I have noticed since 2016 was that I felt more stalked by some stealth anonymous agent(s) than ever before (and I noticed how civillians (including young children) seemed to clamour for my attention (both in public and in places were a desire for privacy would normally be honored) while those children and their preachy, chauninist parents would make antagonistic remarks at me as though I were some kind of Disney villain mascot who was created in some government laboratory for the amusement of sheltered, brainwashed "family first" civillians (and deserving of chronic bullying from the masses as punishment for running away from home and for not making romance (especially the heterosexual variety) and motherhood the center of my life to the exclusion of what I would otherwise want my life to be: absolute freedom to remain single, childless, celibate, limitlessly ambitious, limitlessly creative, and simply happy on my own rather than pining for interpersonal relationships with other human puggy pig apes)).

Even more significant to me is the pattern which I have just now started coming to terms with (this year): the more time, effort, and enthusiasm I invest in a project, the more the human-controlled aspects of my environment seem to deliberately conspire against such efforts. It is almost as if the (human) universe were trying to trick me into thinking that some (superhuman) "divine intervention" from some almighty, anthropocentric, androcentric God were raining down invisible torrents of malice upon me as "punishment" for my refusal to be as meek and as insecure as "His chosen people" seem to want me to be.
