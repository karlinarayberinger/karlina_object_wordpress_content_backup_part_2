STRATEGIC_PESSIMISM

<hr>

I now am convinced that erroring on the side of pessimisn instead of optimism is a much more pragmatic way to handle uncertainty and suffering than is erroring on the side of optimism.

A pattern I have noticed since 2016 was that I felt more stalked by some stealth anonymous agent(s) than ever before (and I noticed how civillians (including young children) seemed to stalk me as though I were some kind of Disney villain mascot who was created in some government laboratory for the amusement of sheltered, brainwashed "family first" civillians).
