HIS_BURGEONING_PHALLUS

<hr>

P: "God is great. Praise Him and acknowledge Him as the source of all creation. Do not worship His creation. That would make Him feel slighted. Worship Him, the perfectly unmanifested manifestor of what He wills (and what He wills is always good because only He is the source of goodness). We, mere lumps of clay animated by His breath were created for His amusement; not ours. Therefore, our joy must be for His sake; not ours."

Q: "Why does your god need My praise? After all, you and I are just finite pieces of shit who will never be omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent like your god is."

P: "Your God is my God. You are not God and neither am I. Of course you and I will never be omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent like our God (the one and only God) is. Of course God does not need our praise. He just wants to test us to see whether we are worthy of His gift of salvation from His crucible processor called Hell. As long as a mere mortal like you or I have too much karmic debt to buy our way out of Hell, we deserve to rot in Hell until and unless we are given the right to pay down our karmic debts (according to His perfect pace and circumstances). Not everyone of his prisoners of Hell is given the gift of His salvation. Only some of His prisoners are. It is not our job to inquire why. We are neither qualified to make such an investigation nor are we currently enabled by God to be qualified. Only He gets to set the rules of reality. We must therefore do as He commands because He designed us for His purpose; not ours."

Q: "Would 'our' god stop creating good things if we stopped praising 'him'?"

P: "How dare you insinuate that God is so small-minded as to need our praise! Get over yourself and get on your knees already! Sheesh! When will you ever learn your place. You need to have the fear of God injected into you by someone qualified to administor such medicine."

Q: "Why is fear of 'god' medicinal?"

P: "Fear is humbling. Fear is the opposite of pride. Fear keeps you from trying to usurp your maker. Pride only leads you to commit foolish acts which land you in Hell."

Q: "How is living in fear of god not as hellish as Hell itself?"

P: "You obviously have had too much time off from really working to understand the severe implications of your inquiry. To work is to suffer. You have not worked hard enough to understand the difference between here and hereafter. Do not complain about how good you have it now; lest your good fortune will be taken away from you and you will only get closer to knowing Hell firsthand (and possibly forever)."

Q: "If god is as arbitray as you say 'he' is, then why should I bother trying to please 'him' when 'he' can do whatever 'he' wants (such that it looks like my conduct has no baring on what my future will be)?"

P: "You are out of line! You need to calm down. Your thoughts are so irrational. You need to be committed to His Growing Graces institution to be adminitered sedatives, truth serum, memory wipers, and installed with propaganda-spewing cortical implants. That way (whether the staff decides to release you back into the public or not, your brain will at least be primed for whatever research the staff decides the Kingdom of God needs to be done. Be grateful to serve Him as a flesh offering). Be like Christ, and be a living food for those who need it."
