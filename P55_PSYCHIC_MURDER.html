<p>PSYCHIC_MURDER</p>
<hr>
<p>Before I threw a metal teaspoon at the back of a family member&#8217;s head in 2018, I did something arguably worse: I threw a handful of rocks over the fence because I was irritated at the sounds which the little boy next door was making. I could have caused a serious injury (if not death) in both instances of physical violence on my behalf. As a consequence, I strongly suspect (and choose to believe) that a sizeable number of people (especially police officers and local residents) literally hate me and want me to suffer extreme agony for the rest of my life (particularly in the form of being electronically lobotomized and psychologically tortured by people (in the form of being taunted, lied to, stolen from, denied employment to dignifying jobs, excluded from fulfilling social relationships, excluded from special interest groups, deprived of praise, deprived of genuinely kind words, harassed to the extent that I am forced to go through an intensely unpleasant nervous breakdown so frequently that I am deliberately prevented from recovering, deliberately made to feel sexually abused and bombarded with unwanted sleazy messages, and intentionally robbed of the means to live in my own domicile such that I am basically forced to pretend that I do not feel as suicidal as I really think I will be forced to feel until I either kill myself or am killed involuntarily).</p>
<p>It looks like every human other than myself without exception wants me to feel abandoned, pain-ridden, ridiculed, hated, exploited, reduced to an inanimate object, and tortured for the cathartic release of other humans and (really) not at all for my benefit.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, not even my family members or former friends want me to establish a career or even a simple self-care routine. I see that I am only given enough economic support and social interaction to make me feel intentionally deprived of a minimally satisfying life.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;Shut up, stop complaining, and get used to being treated like a lost cause you whore,&#8221; is literally the general message I feel humans in general want me to feel is directed my way.</span></p>
<p>Because I feel abused by humans in general (or, at best, dismissed as an inanimate object by humans in general), I do not feel intrinsically motivated to serve humanity. Instead, I want to fight for my own survival while assuming that I am always going to get treated worse than most humans (because most humans seem to think I deserve to suffer worse than a convicted serial killer serving a life-time jail sentence amongst humanity&#8217;s most condemned criminals).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">If my life &#8220;serves&#8221; any intelligent being in a useful manner, what I claim to be willingly providing is a thoughtful expose and analysis of the human psyche from a unique angle which cannot otherwise be created outside of some simulated model. In particular, I provide insights into selfishness and altruism and how both are really one.</span></p>
