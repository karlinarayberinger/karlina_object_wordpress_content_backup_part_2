GAME_CHANGER

Yesterday, after I composed PSYCHIC_MURDER while riding the BART train on an impromptu round trip from Dublin/Pleasanton to Daly City  (and while spending a significant amount of that travel time hiding underneath my rain jacket for maximum privacy), I used my $100 weekly allowance (i.e. a gift from my mother) to pay for a very satisfying Mediterranean food item from Gotta Eatta Pita (a nostalgic little restaurant which I am grateful for having been able to work at for approximately $13 per hour from 21_NOVEMBER_2019 to 13_FEBRUARY_2020). I was also a bit high from the 20 milligrams of cannabis-derived THC I took in tablet form to help aid my writing and enhance my sensory experiences. That meal was perhaps the most exquisitely satisfying dinner I ever had.

What made that meal stand out from all the other meals I have ravebously
