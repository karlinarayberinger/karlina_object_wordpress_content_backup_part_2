Yesterday, after I composed PSYCHIC_MURDER while riding the BART train on an impromptu round trip from Dublin/Pleasanton to Daly City  (and while spending a significant amount of that travel time hiding underneath my rain jacket for maximum privacy), I used my $100 weekly allowance (i.e. a gift from my mother) to pay for a very satisfying Mediterranean food item from Gotta Eatta Pita (a nostalgic little restaurant which I am grateful for having been able to work at for approximately $13 per hour from 21_NOVEMBER_2019 to 13_FEBRUARY_2020). I was also a bit high from the 20 milligrams of cannabis-derived THC I took in tablet form to help aid my writing and to enhance my sensory experiences. That meal was perhaps the most exquisitely satisfying dinner I ever had.

What made that meal stand out from all the other meals I have ravenously consumed while living outside is the chicken meat protein source. I must admit my surprise to see how unhappy I felt not being able to subsist on anything more than carbohydrates and butters due to the fact that I felt militantly committed to eating a vegan (100% plant-based) diet. This is the omnivore's dilemma for the human species and how it evolved to cunningly take advantage of every resource it could. Without animal proteins in my system, I felt easily depleted of sufficient energy to do my best work such that I felt that all I was legally permitted to do was hike, eat, and sleep (and overclock my poor body and mind just by doing a modicum of intellectual work). I will never again allow myself to settle for malnourishment. Until three-dimensionally printed, stem-cell derived, and laboratory meat-like protein becomes the norm at most grocery stores and restaurants (instead of meats which were harvested from the slaughtering of factory-farmed animals), I will eat real meat approximately three times per week (but not fish due to the toxic build up of heavy metals in fish meat and not beef due to the fact that cattle farming is extremely ecologically destructive).
