GAME_CHANGER

Yesterday, after I composed PSYCHIC_MURDER while riding the BART train on an impromptu round trip from Dublin/Pleasanton to Daly City  (and while spending a significant amount of that travel time hiding underneath my rain jacket for maximum privacy), I used my $100 weekly allowance (i.e. a gift from my mother) to pay for a very satisfying Mediterranean food item from Gotta Eatta Pita (a nostalgic little restaurant which I am grateful for having been able to work at for approximately $13 per hour from 21_NOVEMBER_2019 to 13_FEBRUARY_2020). I was also a bit high from the 20 milligrams of cannabis-derived THC I took in tablet form to help aid my writing and to enhance my sensory experiences. That meal was perhaps the most exquisitely satisfying dinner I ever had.

What made that meal stand out from all the other meals I have ravenously consumed while living outside is the chicken meat protein source. I must admit my surprise to see how unhappy I felt not being able to subsist on anything more than carbohydrates and butters due to the fact that I felt militantly committed to eating a vegan (100% plant-based) diet. This is the omnivore's dilemma for the human species and how it evolved to cunningly take advantage of every resource it could. Without animal proteins in my system, I felt easily depleted of sufficient energy to do my best work such that I felt that all I was legally permitted to do was hike, eat, and sleep (and overclock my poor body and mind just by doing a modicum of intellectual work). I will never again allow myself to settle for malnourishment. Until three-dimensionally printed, stem-cell derived, and laboratory meat-like protein becomes the norm at most grocery stores and restaurants (instead of meats which were harvested from the slaughtering of factory-farmed animals), I will eat real meat approximately three times per week (but not fish due to the toxic build up of heavy metals in fish meat and not beef due to the fact that cattle farming is extremely ecologically destructive).

After I ate, I went for a long stroll through what looked like and felt like heaven: a pristine and modern-looking business park full of glassy buildings with minimalist architecture, green lawns, trees bursting with pink cherry blossoms, and the late afternoon sunlight casting its warm luminescence upon everything around me. My body felt rejuvenated and my teenage spirit was summoned from the depths of my iron maiden of a body.

As I walked past a fenced-in field full of short grass (and about 200 meters in length), I saw a large colony of Canadian geese nibbling the ground with their black beaks and muscular long necks craning. I was so damned high at the time that I forgot that geese could fly (and that taking annual long-distance migratory flights as a large formation of a family was a staple of their livelihoods). I felt bad for the poor waddling dinosaurs who could barely get enough to eat at one time. I thought that the geese had no choice but to scuttle around on the ground like dodo birds looking for scraps of food most of their waking hours (which sounds like a hellish amount of slave labor baked in by evolution). I am glad nature does not force any form to stay frozen in some inept configuration forever (and that nature wants its forms to participate in their own evolution rather than to just be passed around as passively as a weed bong from one stoner to the next).

After wandering around (and not wanting to go "home" to the East Bay "ghetto" and "looney tunes asylum" on the other side of the obviously terraformed hill), I decided to camp right where I was standing in a vast open field beneath a starry night sky and full moon. I slept more comfortably last night than I did at the motel (and all the other "power nap" grease spots I used to until today). When I woke up this morning, I was amused by how quiet the surrounding region was, how little garbage and feces there were decorating the streets and side lots, and, most importantly, how fucking clean and fresh the air was to inhale. There was no discernable taste of pollution like there usually is 24 hours per day in the smog-choked, cigarette-smoke drenched, shit-flavored, population-dense ghetto that is Hayward, California. I also noticed that the people I walked past on the sidewalks here in Pleasanton verses Hayward did not project that plaintive, anger-prone, and greedy vibe that people in comparatively poor regions frequently do. 

I must admit that I think there is something fishy about those signs which border Hayward in certain parts which exclaim "no room for racism". What I literally think the signs mean is the following cryptic message: "Warning: the vast majority of local residents are stubbornly regressive Hispanics and this is their Jerusalem. Do not act offended by how little such people mind inflicting bodily harm on their own children by how little they seem to mind keeping the petroleum business alive and well and how reactive such people are when any one dares to think outside the box (especially in terms of improving the air quality through greener transportation). Such residents are the dodo birds of humanity who are too ethnocentric for their own good (i.e. militantly addicted to enforcing unhealthy habits as the one and only way of life until some extraordinarily rich white investor rescues the savages from the ghetto they want to shove into your lungs, eye sockets, and ear canals). Treat the monkey people like Amish people (i.e. surreally quaint, horrifyingly illiterate, and lustful and violence prone to the extent that all they can be expected to do is sedate themselves with alcohol and low-brow entertainment. Let such people rot in their nest of feces while we humbly work to beautify the planet and clean up the ecosystem. The Hispanics are hopelessly addicted to playing dumb, acting hypocritical, and taking offense to even the most trivial slights). That is why I dread going back to the university which devolved into a battle ground for territorial xenophobic monkeys and the spawn they forcefully parade around like prostitutes and pets for their own selfish exploits (by using their own spawn as literal pawns in a dirty game of flesh for blood).
