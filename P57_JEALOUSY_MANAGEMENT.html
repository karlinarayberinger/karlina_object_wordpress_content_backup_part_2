"It is possible for a person to be both hardworking and humble." - anonymous

When people are nice to me, at least one person I know seems to get angry (because the angered persons seem to want me to seriously feel unsupported by everyone as I authentically am) to the extent that the angered persons attempt to punish me (and pretend that is not what they are doing).

Ability to find a silver lining in all situations 

Even after I work hard (and even after I suffer significantly (as in perceive that I am taking non-trivial damage in terms of physiological vitality and longevity)) it seems that some people do not want me to enjoy what I worked hard for.

Why people resort to passive-aggression instead of pure problem solving
