"It is possible for a person to be both hardworking and humble." - anonymous

When people are nice to me, at least one person I know seems to get angry (because the angered persons seem to want me to seriously feel unsupported by everyone as I authentically am) to the extent that the angered persons attempt to punish me (and pretend that is not what they are doing).

"Oh well," is my answer to that. Next...

I have a knack for always being able to find a "silver lining" to every situation (even the "worst" situations). What that means is that I am able to always invent some philosophical reason to be as happy as possible with every situation. 

From what I can tell, the angered persons I mentioned earlier are especially irritated by my ability to always find a silver lining in every situation. For that reason, I feel obliged to hide any strong emotions (whether negative or positive) in order to avoid getting attacked by the referenced angered persons.

Ability to find a silver lining in all situations 

Even after I work hard (and even after I suffer significantly (as in perceive that I am taking non-trivial damage in terms of physiological vitality and longevity)) it seems that some people do not want me to enjoy what I worked hard for.

Why people resort to passive-aggression instead of pure problem solving
