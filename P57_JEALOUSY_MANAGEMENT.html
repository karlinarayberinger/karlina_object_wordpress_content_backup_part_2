When people are nice to me, at least one person I know seems to get angry (because the angered persons seem to want me to seriously feel unsupported by everyone as I authentically am) to the extent that the angered persons attempt to punish me (and pretend that is not what they are doing).

<hr>

"Oh well," is my answer to that. Next...

I have a knack for always being able to find a "silver lining" to every situation (even the "worst" situations). What that means is that I am able to always invent some philosophical reason to be as happy as possible with every situation. 

From what I can tell, the angered persons I mentioned earlier are especially irritated by my ability to always find a silver lining in every situation. For that reason, I feel obliged to hide any strong emotions (whether negative or positive) in order to avoid getting attacked by the referenced angered persons.

Even after I work hard (and even after I suffer significantly (as in perceive that I am taking non-trivial damage in terms of physiological vitality and longevity)) it seems that some persons (and not all persons) do not want me to enjoy what I worked hard for.

From what I can tell, the persons who do not want me to reap the benefits of my own investments and efforts want me to lack ambition such that I am guaranteed to never reap more goodies out of life than those persons will. That is those persons' way of "leveling the playing field" so that jealousy is minimized. We might as well just kill ourselves then and leave the playing field empty.

From what I can tell, it almost seems as if I was specifically raised to perform exactly one function: be a human role model who demonstrates what it is like to be raised to identify as being affluent yet ignorant about how the world beyond one's small-minded bubble to bring forced to adapt to society sans the affluence in a "riches to rags to riches" formulaic hero's journey story tailor made for the masses (especially for affluent children such that they can smugly cling to their childhood circumstances much longer than I would want them to in order for those adult children to be perpetually available to care for their elderly parents). That is why "respect your elders" is a moral instruction I do not condone. I think parents owe their children care and not the reverse. That is because the parents presumably chose to have children while the children are born into the custody of their parents with little to no say over their formative (i.e. childhood) circumstances.

I do my absolute best to respect all persons at all times and unconditionally.

Why people resort to passive-aggression instead of pure problem-solving is this: people who are terrorized into feigning incompetence are afraid to sound smart and emotionally neutral. As a result, such people have no choice but to drop hints about how they really feel because they are "forced to" wear a mask (metaphorically speaking) and to project a shell persona which is as limited as the mask. That is why I strongly recommend that each person keep its own personal record of journal entries in a public medium (especially via a blog and a social network by which to share that blog and to help other bloggers gain readership). As long as I am free to practice my religion of minimally-censored public web-based journaling, I do not feel oppressed. That is because I am a writer and an appreciator of experiences and ideas. That is my self-defined purpose in life. As long as I am free to devote myself to my chosen life purpose, it is almost impossible for me to feel angry for any longer than a few seconds.
