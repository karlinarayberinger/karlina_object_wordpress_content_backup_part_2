<p>JEALOUSY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;It is possible for a person to be both hardworking and humble.&#8221; &#8211; anonymous</p>
<hr>
<p>When people are nice to me, at least one person I know seems to get angry (because the angered persons seem to want me to seriously feel unsupported by everyone as I authentically am) to the extent that the angered persons attempt to punish me (and pretend that is not what they are doing).</p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; is my answer to that. Next&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I have a knack for always being able to find a &#8220;silver lining&#8221; to every situation (even the &#8220;worst&#8221; situations). What that means is that I am able to always invent some philosophical reason to be as happy as possible with every situation.</span></p>
<p>From what I can tell, the angered persons I mentioned earlier are especially irritated by my ability to always find a silver lining in every situation. For that reason, I feel obliged to hide any strong emotions (whether negative or positive) in order to avoid getting attacked by the referenced angered persons.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even after I work hard (and even after I suffer significantly (as in perceive that I am taking non-trivial damage in terms of physiological vitality and longevity)) it seems that some persons (and not all persons) do not want me to enjoy what I worked hard for.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the persons who do not want me to reap the benefits of my own investments and efforts want me to lack ambition such that I am guaranteed to never reap more goodies out of life than those persons will. That is those persons&#8217; way of &#8220;leveling the playing field&#8221; so that jealousy is minimized. We might as well just kill ourselves then and leave the playing field empty.</p>
<hr>
<p>From what I can tell, it almost seems as if I was specifically raised to perform exactly one function: be a human role model who demonstrates what it is like to be raised to identify as being affluent yet ignorant about how the world works beyond one&#8217;s family of origin and then (with minimal preparation) attempt to adapt to society sans the affluence in a &#8220;riches to rags to riches&#8221; formulaic hero&#8217;s journey story tailor made for the masses (especially for affluent children such that they can smugly cling to their childhood circumstances much longer than I would want them to in order for those adult children to be perpetually available to care for their elderly parents). That is why &#8220;respect your elders&#8221; is a moral instruction I do not condone. I think parents owe their children care and not the reverse. That is because the parents presumably chose to have children (unless they were raped, forced to give birth, and/or forced to be the legal guardian of a child) while the children are born into the custody of their parents with little to no say over their formative (i.e. childhood) circumstances.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I do my absolute best to respect all persons at all times and unconditionally.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Why people resort to passive-aggression instead of pure problem-solving is this: people who are terrorized into feigning incompetence are afraid to sound smart and emotionally neutral. As a result, such people have no choice but to drop hints about how they really feel because they are &#8220;forced to&#8221; wear a mask (metaphorically speaking) and to project a shell persona which is as limited as the mask. That is why <span style="background:#ffff00;">I strongly recommend that each person keep its own personal record of journal entries in a public medium (especially via a blog and a social network by which to share that blog and to help other bloggers gain readership).</span> As long as I am free to practice my religion of minimally-censored public web-based journaling, I do not feel oppressed. That is because I am a writer and an appreciator of experiences and ideas. That is my self-defined purpose in life. As long as I am free to devote myself to my chosen life purpose, it is almost impossible for me to feel angry for any longer than a few seconds.</p>
<p>Passive-aggression is procrastination. Therefore, it is inefficient and unnecessarily stressful (as well as irrational).</p>
<p>Just because other persons are passive-aggressive does not mean I have to be (even if such persons try to force me to be). Even if I am locked up in prison (which I have been more times than I can count), I made a point of not defaulting to passive-aggression. Instead, I took every measure possible to find a silver lining in my prison sentence and to make it a philosophical experiment.</p>
