<p><strong>CORRELATION:</strong> the observation of two separate events occurring within one finite interval of space and time such that those events appear to have no effect on each other&#8217;s manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSATION:</strong> the observation of two separate events occurring within one finite interval of space and time such that one of those events (i.e. the oldest event) apparently caused the other event (i.e. the newest event) to manifest such that the newest event would presumably would have not manifested unless the older event manifested exactly as it appeared to have (from the vantage of exactly one &#8220;point&#8221; of observation and analysis of empirical and memorized information).</p>

<p>CORRELATION : INDEPENDENCE :: CAUSATION : DEPENDENCE.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>DEPENDENCE:</strong> the quality of a phenomenon manifesting as a result of some temporally prior phenomenon manifesting. Dependence implicitly includes a unidirectional arrow of time such that time appears to be the container of space (and space changes at a particular rate (such that the rate may speed up or slow down at any point along some finite time interval in which that finite region of space is being observed by exactly one relatively fixed &#8220;point&#8221; of observation)).</p>
<p><strong>INTERDEPENDENCE:</strong> the quality of two phenomena being the cause of each other&#8217;s existence (such that there is no implicit unidirectional arrow of time nor sense of time passing since both phenomena appear to be updating each other instantaneously (i.e. without any observed propagation delay) as a result of quantum entanglement).</p>
