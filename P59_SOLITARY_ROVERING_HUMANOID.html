I ate three chicken dinners from my favorite restaurant (one per each of the past three consecutive days).

I took three cannabis tablets simultaneously; each containing 10 milligrams of TetraHydroCannabinol.

I am a level-ten first-person-shooter video-game first-person player armed with a cyborg's body, a traveling office setup, and a green laser pointer (which is powered by a USB-cable-to-lithiom-ion-battery and which outputs X amount of light (whose wavelengths are approximately 500 nanometers)).
