I ate three chicken dinners from my favorite restaurant (one per each of the past three consecutive days).

I took three cannabis tablets simultaneously; each containing 10 milligrams of TetraHydroCannabinol.

Memories come more randomly to me exactly as I want them to be (seemingly).

I am a level-ten first-person-shooter video-game first-person player armed with a cyborg's body, a traveling office setup, and a green laser pointer (which is powered by a USB-cable-to-lithiom-ion-battery and which outputs X amount of light (whose wavelengths are approximately 500 nanometers)).

I pretend that each ugly charicature which rears its ugly head in my field of awareness is a level-one non-playable foe to shoot down with my extra powerful light beam vaporiser gun (powered by thoughts)!

<strong>ANTI_SOCIAL !== ASOCIAL</strong>

<hr>

My super power is my ability to not give other embodied humanoids my affirmation.

That is why I have more time to think about the universe than most of those partialities.

<strong>ANTI_SOCIAL:</strong> the belief which some humanoid hosts such that the belief consists of the following message: humanoids (and other sufficiently sentient entities) are parasites.

<strong>ASOCIAL:</strong> ANTI_SOCIAL: the belief which some humanoid hosts such that the belief consists of the following message: humanoids and other sufficiently sentient creatures suffice for my continued level of happiness.

<strong>SOCIAL:</strong> I must pretend I am one of the individual members of the dominant species.
