<p>&#8220;Solitude is the sought after gem of crystalline transparency which affluence promises to deliver those who obtain it.&#8221; &#8211; anonymous</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want my own apartment, man!&#8221; &#8211; anonymous</p>
<hr>
<p>I ate three chicken dinners from my favorite restaurant (one per each of the past three consecutive days).</p>
<p>I took three cannabis tablets simultaneously; each containing 10 milligrams of TetraHydroCannabinol.</p>
<p>Memories come more randomly to me exactly as I want them to be (seemingly).</p>
<hr>
<p>I am a level-ten first-person-shooter video-game first-person player armed with a cyborg&#8217;s body, a traveling office setup, and a green laser pointer (which is powered by a USB charging port which my laptop battery can recharge and which outputs a strong and focused beam of green light (whose wavelengths are approximately 500 nano-meters per light wave)).</p>
<p>I pretend that each ugly caricature which rears its ugly head in my field of awareness is a level-one non-playable foe to shoot down with my extra powerful light beam vaporizer gun (powered by thoughts)! (By ugly, I mean whatever makes me feel the same &#8220;unfathomable&#8221; way).</p>
<p>Bare in mind that I am speaking of imaginary objects which I willingly hallucinate for amusement. I would never want to intentionally harm some sentient creature.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ANTI_SOCIAL !== ASOCIAL</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>My super power is my ability to not give other embodied humanoids my affirmation.</p>
<p>That is why I have more time to think about the universe than most of those partialities.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ANTI_SOCIAL:</strong> the belief which some humanoid hosts such that the belief consists of the following message: humanoids (and other sufficiently sentient entities) are parasites.</p>
<p><strong>ASOCIAL:</strong> the belief which some humanoid hosts such that the belief consists of the following message: humanoids and other sufficiently sentient creatures suffice for my continued level of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>SOCIAL:</strong> I must pretend I am one of the individual members of the dominant species.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">I reserve the right to remain solitary for eternity. My will be done. Eternity is mine.</strong></p>
