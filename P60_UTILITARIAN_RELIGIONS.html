UTILITARIAN_RELIGIONS

<hr>

A train of thought which would presumably only take about ten minutes to run its course such that a satisfying conclusion is obtained seems to rake hours, days, weeks, months, and years longer than it "should" as a result of my being so frequently interrupted and neurologically conditioned (against my will) to make someone else's salience filter a substitute for my own preferred salience filter. That is why I am currently stationed within about a mile's radius from Dublin/Pleasanton BART station instead of the grimy, congested inner city lining the East Bay on the west side of this oasis which reminds me of Merced and the delight of being about an hour's drive from Yosemite National Park (and I do not have a car, but if I do, it shall be electric and it may even be a self-driving Tesla taxi which I summon with the power of my smartphone to whisk me away on a solitary luxury trip to the Sierra National Forest).
