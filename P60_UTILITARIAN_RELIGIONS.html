<p><strong>PART_0: SCARCITY_OF_IMAGINATION</strong></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">A train of thought which would presumably only take about ten minutes to run its course such that a satisfying conclusion is obtained seems to rake hours, days, weeks, months, and years longer than it &#8220;should&#8221; as a result of my being so frequently interrupted and neurologically conditioned (against my will) to make someone else&#8217;s salience filter a substitute for my own preferred salience filter.</span> That is why I am currently stationed within about a mile&#8217;s radius from Dublin/Pleasanton BART station instead of the grimy, congested inner city lining the East Bay on the west side of this oasis which reminds me of Merced and the delight of being about an hour&#8217;s drive from Yosemite National Park (and I do not have a car, but if I do, it shall be electric and it may even be a self-driving Tesla taxi which I summon with the power of my smartphone to whisk me away on a solitary luxury trip to the Sierra National Forest).</p>
<p><strong>PART_1: JOIN_OUR_CULT_OR_SUFFER_OUR_INDIFFERENCE</strong></p>
<p>There is a famous quote which is similar to the following message: &#8220;To find out who rules over you, look to whoever you are not allowed to criticize.&#8221; <span style="background:#ffff00;">Yes, I believe that certain people are literally paid to cut my attention span short, to deplete me of energy and euphoric neurotransmitters, to deprive me of an otherwise unimpeded Internet connection, to overload my working memory with macabre and quaint junk news, and to brainwash me into thinking I have an innate cognitive impairment when I have a healthy and strong central nervous system capable of penetrating through the layers of bullshit</span> deception to see the sham for what it is: scared little mice under pressure to serve their relentless survival demands (which they helped to exacerbate by cornering each other under the tyranny of boredom and stress to get impregnated, give birth to, and stay chained to small and dependent human beings) while keeping Americans married to their petroleum powered vehicles and crowded households as if no other alternatives were viable within their reach. I blame the small mindedness of the Catholic prioritization which seems to keep certain metropolitan regions hermetically sealed inside of antiquated and pollution-heavy ravines (while human flesh is sacrificed in exchange for divine and favoritist afterlife preservation of blindly faithful souls).</p>
<p>What is the price to breathe even a single breath of clean air? One must be willing to choke on toxic fumes until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ; when the undead intermediary between humans and their anthropocentric God comes floating down from heaven on a beam of white light and whisks away His chosen keepers of the faith (while everyone else is left to choke to death and charbroil in the flame-enveloped Earth).</p>
<p>According to most denominations of Christianity (including Catholicism), a human must consciously and voluntarily appoint some imaginary deity named Jesus Christ as its supreme authority and savior from all unsavory conditions on Planet Earth. Otherwise, that person is voluntarily rejecting the gift of salvation from an eternity in some torture chamber called Hell (and, according to the rhetoric of the religion, such a person allegedly deserves to be punished as severely as any other non-believer since the Christian worldview is the antithesis of meritocracy).</p>
<p><strong>PART_2: UNCONDITIONAL_ACCEPTANCE</strong></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Some (relatively modern) denominations of Christianity do not require that any human believe in the tenets of any particular religion or moral doctrine in order to receive salvation through the instrument of Jesus Christ as well as divine assistance from the Holy Spirit itself</span> (and the Holy Spirit is the reductionist form of God while Jesus and God are Son and Father archetypes to aid the human imagination). This is particularly true of Unitarian Universalism; a rather open-ended community of people whose personal epistemological and ethical beliefs can differ quite radically since all Unitarian Universalists presumably believe that (a) each and every human being deserves unconditional salvation by Jesus Christ and (b) religion is meant to be open-ended and individualistic rather than closed off to new possibilities and conformist.</p>
<p>Of course, I no longer go to church. Nature is my God. Nature is in every thing and encompassing of every thing. Nature is an ongoing source of inspiration for me. This blog is a manifestation of my appreciation of Nature.</p>

<p><strong>PART_3: TYRANNY_OF_THE_WEAK</strong></p>
<p>Until I get to a place where I can actually upload an image to this WordPress account, I am leaving the following text in place of the image I am trying to upload:</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(I am trying to add an image, but I seem to have to go where the wimps want me to go. Lest they censor me and call it my handicap).</span></p>
<p>That makes me want to leave this post on the following sensationalist note (since endless petulance is the only appetite that seems to demand that I feed it in terms of whomever is considered to be the most important human being in my life: the gate keepers of basic economic resources and the endorses of censorship: women who attempt to handicap other women because they want to make handicapped women the only women so that women can stay stunted and, therefore, an immutable burden for the able bodied to upkeep. Of course, such whores only give to get. They rarely give without intentionally inflicting harm on those they give to. Without animosity, life is too boring for them).</p>
<p>I say bigoted things with the hopes that, eventually, empirical evidence will prove me wrong (or, at the very least, that the bigoted comments I make are about something guaranteed to become obsolete).</p>
<p>I have an issue with sexism more so than other types of human discrimination because I think it is the single greatest factor in why humans have not progressed as smoothly and as quickly as I would have expected them to approximately ten years ago when I first got immersed in futuristic literature and computer science. I want to see more women (and people in general) pursuing higher trains of thought than the regurgitated, low-brow manure which seems to circulate endlessly through the collective subconscious. Or maybe I am just a crazy femtard. Sorry I prefer to travel alone than to sit and pretend to be entertained by some man who treats me as his captive audience, indentured servant, and designated scapegoat for all that is wrong with society?</p>
