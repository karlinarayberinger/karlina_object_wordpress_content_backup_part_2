<strong>PART_0: SCARCITY_OF_IMAGINATION</strong>

A train of thought which would presumably only take about ten minutes to run its course such that a satisfying conclusion is obtained seems to rake hours, days, weeks, months, and years longer than it "should" as a result of my being so frequently interrupted and neurologically conditioned (against my will) to make someone else's salience filter a substitute for my own preferred salience filter. That is why I am currently stationed within about a mile's radius from Dublin/Pleasanton BART station instead of the grimy, congested inner city lining the East Bay on the west side of this oasis which reminds me of Merced and the delight of being about an hour's drive from Yosemite National Park (and I do not have a car, but if I do, it shall be electric and it may even be a self-driving Tesla taxi which I summon with the power of my smartphone to whisk me away on a solitary luxury trip to the Sierra National Forest).

<strong>PART_1: JOIN_OUR_CULT_OR_SUFFER_OUR_INDIFFERENCE</strong>

There is a famous quote which is similar to the following message: "To find out who rules over you, look to whoever you are not allowed to criticize." Yes, I believe that certain people are literally paid to cut my attention span short, to deplete me of energy and euphoric neurotransmitters, to deprive me of an otherwise unimpeded Internet connection, to overload my working memory with macabre and quaint junk news, and to brainwash me into thinking I have an innate cognitive impairment when I have a healthy and strong central nervous system capable of penetrating through the layers of bullshit deception to see the sham for what it is: scared little mice under pressure to serve their relentless survival demands while keeping Americans married to their petroleum powered vehicles and crowded household as if no other alternatives were viable within their reach. I blame the small mindedness of the Catholic prioritization which seems to keep certain metropolitan regions hermetically sealed inside of antiquated and pollution-heavy ravines (while human flesh is sacrificed in exchange for divine and favoritist afterlife preservation of blindly faithful souls).

What is the price to breathe even a single breath of clean air? One must be willing to choke on toxic fumes until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ; the undead intermediary between humans and their anthropocentric God.

According to most denominations of Christianity (including Catholicism), a human must consciously and voluntarily appoint some imaginary deity named Jesus Christ as its supreme authority and savior from all unsavory conditions on Planet Earth.

<strong>PART_2: UNCONDITIONAL_ACCEPTANCE</strong>

Some (relatively modern) denominations of Christianity do not require that any human believe in the tenets of any particular religion or moral doctrine in order to receive salvation through the instrument of Jesus Christ as well as divine assistance from the Holy Spirit itself (and the Holy Spirit is the reductionist form of God while Jesus and God are Son and Father archetypes to aid the human imagination). This is particularly true of Unitarian Universalism; a rather open-ended community of people whose personal epistemological and ethical beliefs can differ quite radically since all Unitarian Universalists presumably believe that (a) each and every human being deserves unconditional salvation by Jesus Christ and (b) religion is meant to be open-ended and individualistic rather than closed off to new possibilities and conformist. 

Of course, I no longer go to church. Nature is my God. Nature is in every thing and encompassing of every thing. Nature is an ongoing source of inspiration for me. This blog is a manifestation of my appreciation of Nature.
