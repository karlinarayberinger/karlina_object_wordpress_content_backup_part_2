First of all, ensure that there exist a sufficient number of photovoltaic cells which work properly and which are contributing a sufficiently high daily electricity output before closing down all polluting types of electricity generating facilities.

Secondly, require that all cars in service include a self-driving override feature which takes over the acceleration and steering controls of the vehicle if an accident is anticipated by the vehicle's built-in safety mechanisms (and that all vehicles in service are electrically powered rather than petroleum combusion powered).

Thirdly, provide a cheap (or entirely tax-funded and/or donation-funded) taxi service which enables people who do not own cars the opportunity to cheaply and conveniently use a mobile phone application to arrange for a ride in self-driving car such that the person can get in the car and the car drives itself along the planned route (making "real time" adaptations as needed but doing all the navigation work so that the human passenger does not use up "too much" of that car's battery charge and components longevity).

Fourthly, ensure that lots full of three-dimensionally printed, environmentally-sustainable shelters (next to a communal bathroom which includes showers, drinking water outlets, electrical outlets, car charging ports, stationary phones, and a real estate office) exist on the outskirts of every major metropolis such that low-income, low-impact persons can live cheaply there.
