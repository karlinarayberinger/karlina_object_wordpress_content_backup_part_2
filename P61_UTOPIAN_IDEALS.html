<p>UTOPIAN_IDEALS</p>
<hr>
<p>If I were the supreme leader of the humans, this is the kind of itinerary I would want to open my first presentation with&#8230;</p>
<hr>
<p>1. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Ensure that there exist a sufficient number of photovoltaic cells which work properly and which are contributing a sufficiently high daily electricity output before closing down all polluting types of electricity generating facilities.</span></p>
<p>2. Require that all cars in service include a self-driving override feature which takes over the acceleration and steering controls of the vehicle if an accident is anticipated by the vehicle&#8217;s built-in safety mechanisms (and that all vehicles in service are electrically powered rather than petroleum combustion powered).</p>
<p>3. Provide a cheap (or entirely tax-funded and/or donation-funded) taxi service which enables people who do not own cars the opportunity to cheaply and conveniently use a mobile phone application to arrange for a ride in self-driving car such that the person can get in the car and the car drives itself along the planned route (making &#8220;real time&#8221; adaptations as needed but doing all the navigation work so that the human passenger does not use up &#8220;too much&#8221; of that car&#8217;s battery charge and components longevity).</p>
<p>4. Ensure that lots full of three-dimensionally printed, environmentally-sustainable shelters (next to a communal bathroom which includes showers, drinking water outlets, electrical outlets, car charging ports, stationary phones, and a real estate office) exist on the outskirts of every major metropolis such that low-income, low-impact persons can live cheaply there.</p>
<p>5. Ensure that lots of greenhouses are stationed in every major metropolis which produce an abundance of nutritious plant-based foods such that the food produced by such farms is practically free (and left over food is composted and used to make fertilizer and to power heat-to-electricity power plants).</p>
<p>6. Replace tree-derived paper products, wood, and other materials with hemp-based alternatives such that paper, cloth, and other industrial-grade materials can be quickly and sustainably grown (and so that forest clearing almost never has to occur).</p>
<p>7. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Hire as many robots as necessary to replace human beings at most essential jobs (and pair each of those robots with at least one human &#8220;slave driver&#8221; such that the human &#8220;slave driver&#8221; is given most of the income those robots earn from working in inhumane yet highly efficient conditions while the humans pocket the cash and pay their taxes as usual).</span></p>
<p>8. Require that all children attend public school which includes the option for a child to (on its own volition) spend the night at school and to receive tax-funded meals, rent, utilities, and healthcare such that no child ever has to go back to its family of origin for any reason.</p>
<p>9. Legalize all drugs (for consenting adults aged 18 and older) on a &#8220;partake at your own risk&#8221; basis.</p>
<p>10. Ban prison sentences which are longer than three years for all crimes (and keep all citizens regardless of criminal background under the control of brain-to-computer interfaces which monitor their thoughts, behavior, and perceptions and which (as necessary) override a person&#8217;s thoughts, behavior, and perceptions in order to prevent serious harm).</p>
<p>11. Make stem-cell body parts replacement procedures available for all people (such that each person&#8217;s longevity and bodily functions are extended for as long as possible).</p>
<p>12. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Enforce mass temporary sterilization on all citizens such that only citizens who are able to meet the proper prerequisites to contributing genetic material, gestating a fetus, and/or raising a human child are permitted to do so. If too few people qualify to breed, then allow laboratories to &#8220;print&#8221; stem-cell derived human beings from ideal genenotypes stored in government data bases such that the population growth/decay rates are stable within healthy ranges (and so that the majority of living humans are born with robust genes rather than sickly ones).</span></p>
