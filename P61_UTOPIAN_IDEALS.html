<span style="background:#ffff00;">First of all, ensure that there exist a sufficient number of photovoltaic cells which work properly and which are contributing a sufficiently high daily electricity output before closing down all polluting types of electricity generating facilities.</span>

Secondly, require that all cars in service include a self-driving override feature which takes over the acceleration and steering controls of the vehicle if an accident is anticipated by the vehicle's built-in safety mechanisms (and that all vehicles in service are electrically powered rather than petroleum combusion powered).

Thirdly, provide a cheap (or entirely tax-funded and/or donation-funded) taxi service which enables people who do not own cars the opportunity to cheaply and conveniently use a mobile phone application to arrange for a ride in self-driving car such that the person can get in the car and the car drives itself along the planned route (making "real time" adaptations as needed but doing all the navigation work so that the human passenger does not use up "too much" of that car's battery charge and components longevity).

Fourthly, ensure that lots full of three-dimensionally printed, environmentally-sustainable shelters (next to a communal bathroom which includes showers, drinking water outlets, electrical outlets, car charging ports, stationary phones, and a real estate office) exist on the outskirts of every major metropolis such that low-income, low-impact persons can live cheaply there.

Fifthly, ensure that lots of greenhouses are stationed in every major metropolis which produce an abundance of nutritious plant-based foods such that the food produced by such farms is practically free (and left over food is composted and used to make fertilizer and to power heat-to-electricity power plants).

Sixly, replace tree-derived paper products, wood, and other materials with hemp-based alternatives such that paper, cloth, and other industrial-grade materials can be quickly and sustainably grown (and so that forest clearing almost never has to occur).

<span style="background:#ffff00;">Seventhly, hire as many robots as necessary to replace human beings at most essential jobs (and pair each of those robots with at least one human "slave driver" such that the human "slave driver" is given most of the income those robots earn from working in inhumane yet highly efficient conditions while the humans pocket the cash and pay their taxes as usual).</span>

Require that all children attend public school which includes the option for a child to (on its own volition) spend the night at school and to receive tax-funded meals, rent, utilities, and healthcare such that no child ever has to go back to its family of origin for any reason.

Legalize all drugs (for consenting adults aged 18 and older) on a "partake at your own risk" basis.

Ban prison sentences which are longer than three years for all crimes (and keep all citizens regardless of criminal background under the control of brain-to-computer interfaces which monitor their thoughts, behavior, and perceptions and which (as necessary) override a person's thoughts, behavior, and perceptions in order to prevent serious harm).

Make stem-cell body parts replacement procedures available for all people (such that each person's longevity and bodily functions are extended for as long as possinble).
