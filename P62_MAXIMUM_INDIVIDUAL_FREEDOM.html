S: "If I had my way, I would control the distribution of the human world's resources such that there would be more than enough nutritious and varied food for every individual human being and each individual human being would have 24 hours per day to do whatever it wants (so long as what it is doing is determined by artificially intelligent surveillance networks to not inflict significant damage on another person or the environment) while being given an unconditional minimum income (some fixed rate per month) and plenty of low-stress opportunities to earn extra income through contract jobs and by participating in research studies."

T: "I like your idea. It sounds like there would be less of an incentive to sleep one's life away while anxiously and angrily waiting for barely enough money to come in (even while working for money and not just living on government issued financial aid alone) to do much more than clock into work, take care of household chores, watch a little television, and go to sleep only to do it all again the next day (while sleep deprived, malnourished, over stressed, under exercised, under stimulated in creativity and intelligence enhancing ways, and freedom to spend one's time as freely as one would be able to presumably every day in your utopia)."

S: "As long as a person's job does not fulfill needs beyond just providing money, it will likely feel like a prison sentence to perform such a job. As much as I wish I could simply wave a magic wand and manifest my ideal vision of human civilization, I know I have to accept that human civilization is largely still in the dark ages and a far way off from being as utopian as I wish it was. Therefore, I would recommend that we focus on how to make jobs more fulfilling and less wasteful of people's time, energy, and momentum. That means we need to deploy more robots to do the bulk of the heavy labor so that humans can do easier and more enjoyable jobs alongside the robots."

T: "Karlina said 99% of the jobs should be outsourced to artificially intelligent robots while each robot is paired with at least one human 'slave driver' (see UTOPIAN_IDEALS for more information on the matter). Karlina said that the human 'slave drivers' who oversee the progress and status of their slave robots should get paid most of what the robots would be paid such that the human 'slave drivers' still pay their taxes (which helps to keep the infrastructure of human civilization running smoothly) and a modicum of that money would otherwise be spent on maintaining the robots and their factories of employment."

S: "I cannot think of a seriously good reason to be against that proposition."

T: "Neither can I!"
