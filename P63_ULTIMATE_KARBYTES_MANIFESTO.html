<p>It is possible that I may never know any other human being as deeply as I have in the past nor meet any other human being as likeable to me as any other human being I used to know from the past. That is okay with me. I am a hermit and I want to stop pretending otherwise so that I can hurry up and discard this fake facade of forced social positioning and simply devote the rest of my life to being harmlessly self centered and skillfully asocial. Perhaps friendship is too highly venerated by humans simply because humans evolved to be a social species dependent on ingratiating themselves to the dominant members of society in order to survive. Perhaps the most controversial (and philosophically satisfying) thing I can do is boycott human friendship as little more than an innocent-looking scam. I may not live long enough to attain a higher standard of living than the current one I have. Hence, I will treat every day as though it were my last.</p>
