<p><strong>PART_1: OBESE_PEOPLE_ARE_SLOVENLY_MORONS</strong></p>
<p>Obese people appear mentally unsophisticated to me because they &#8220;superficially&#8221; appear to be bad at managing their resource consumption in a balanced way and, because they are bad managing their caloric input/output, they presumably also are malnourished because they do not have a minimally adequate understanding of how the human body works and why certain nutrients (and not just calories and appetite satiation) are essential to optimum functioning. Such people are also likely to carelessly pollute the environment because they do not mind driving gasoline guzzling cars because they are seduced by the lowest hanging fruits which advertisers peddle to their primitive, impulse-driven lifestyles. Such people are also likely to not want to learn more about how the factory farmed animal flesh they are consumed was derived because such consumers just want to feel good (and knowing that sentient animals were tortured for their benefit is not exactly feel-good). In short, I am tired of hiding my disgust at the obesity industry and the way I am expected to treat obese people like easily-offended royalty. Hence, wherever I end up working, it will not be peddling factory farmed animal flesh. I am done eating animal products. I am restarting my commitment to adhering to a strictly plant-based diet. I am not skimping on my environmentalist and futuristic values.</p>

<p><strong>PART_2: WORK_LIFE_BALANCE_ATTEMPTS</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps I should look for only part time non-remote work and then spend the rest of my week doing remote work. That might be the most robust option.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PART_3: CUCK_HOLD_JOBS</strong></p>
<p>After some consideration, I decided to not apply for customer service jobs and, instead, look for remote work only. Time is of the essence. Also, customer service jobs are frequently demoralizing and rather limiting of what I think, say, and do even while not clocked into work. There is a big old university with decent Internet connection and I am getting along better with all the people in my life (so I no longer have to stay in survival mode).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PART_4: PUSHED_UP_AGAINST_A_WALL_JOBS</strong></p>
<p>I am now willing to apply for customer service jobs instead of just 100% relying on my laptop and phone for all my professional needs. I am afraid of remote work scams and my computer malfunctioning such that I waste a lot of time trying to make money which never reaches my hands. If I pad my bank account with the money I earn from a brick and mortar job, I can afford to replace my laptop and pay for art supplies and media downloads so I can keep expanding my personal website (which is separate from my W-2 job). Also, now that I have come to terms with my asociality, I feel that I can more humbly and comfortably work in customer service jobs than I used to. Sadly, some people are opposed to me having a life outside the home (to the point that they do not want me to work unless it is 100% remote).</p>
