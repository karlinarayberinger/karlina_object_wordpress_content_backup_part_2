LONG_TERM_PERSONAL_PLANNING

<hr>

As I learn to adapt to living outside full time while subsisting on as little money as possible (but not at the expense of what I think is a minimally satisfying quality of life), I find it impossible to be nocturnal as I used to while living with more accommodations (and more supervision). It is easy for me to sleep through the night and wake up naturally when the sunrises. I am doing my best to not settle for a kind of job and lifestyle which makes me feel like a traitor to my own cause. I have no idea if or when I will get a job, but I think it is reasonable to expect that I will have a job by the end of the year.
