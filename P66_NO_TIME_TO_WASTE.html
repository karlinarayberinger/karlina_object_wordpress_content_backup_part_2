<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: This journal entry especially and the ones prior to this one document my &#8220;insecure phase&#8221;. These journal entries were written in conditions in which I felt that I had to be ready to pack up and leave with little to no warning because I have apparently overstayed my welcome where my parents&#8217; live (and it seems that they do not want me to have a career because they would rather see me rot as punishment for not moving out sooner). Hence, this note encapsulates a very important &#8220;modern&#8221; survival skill which I have learned: <span style="background:#ffff00;">always project a pleasant demeanor while keeping candid thoughts and feelings limited to artistic outlets (such as blogging) and to silent observation (whether or not thought police can observe them as well).</span></p>

<p>A few hours ago, I awoke from a series of dreams which were actually quite satisfying. I dreamt that SD (my former lover and best friend during the years 2009 to 2015) invited me to live with him and his new partner in a polyamorous situation and I was playing with plastic toy soldiers and building blocks in some dimly lit bedroom. While participating in an interactive online science/technology lecture which felt surreally like a &#8220;real&#8221; classroom full of other students who I could see and touch (and someone put their arm around me in an affectionate manner which I enjoyed), I was having fun posting comments to a live comments section while the lecture was in progress.</p>
<p>I woke up, found a $20 bill on the ground, and used it to buy copious amounts of coffee from the nearby coffee shop. As I waited in line at the coffee shop, I observed how all the employees (approximately 6 of them) were all doing something and not just standing idly. That&#8217;s the kind of job I think would be most ideal for me to apply for today once I get back to a location with better Internet than the weak connection which my phone provides. (Yes, I am going back to California State University East Bay in Hayward).</p>
<p>Last night I was tentatively planning on getting a &#8220;green page&#8221; published which features some binary-to-decimal JavaScript application but I decided to go to bed early because I felt a bit depressed. I felt that I had no choice but to suffer for a living (and that certain peoples wanted to sabotage my love of science and technology because they wanted to keep me hostage for their political agenda). At this point, I have so little left to lose that I am not taking no for an answer when those antagonists try to gang up on me and deprive me of the right to pursue science and technology hobbies. (I am not here to babysit their spawn nor tell them how to live (especially since such people only want me to tell them what they want to hear)). I will not let bullies (real or imagined) terrorize me to the point that all I do is survive and placate them. I have so much more to think about than what they seem to want me to think about that I imagine their heads (atop bloated bodies) contain only 1 thought for every 1000 thoughts an actual software engineer or neuroscientist would have. (Of course, I&#8217;m being a little bombastic and not precise in this journal entry because I have not even started my career-oriented writings yet. All I have populated this book with is material designed to help me overcome my insecurity (and I cannot do much more than I am to prevent theft, harassment, and bodily harm)).</p>
<p>When I apply to jobs as a barista (or something similar), I am doing so with the premise that I am a student first and foremost (and I intend to pay for whatever certification and training I need to become a full-time technician). The reason I am not doing that now is that my mother (the sole provider of my money) seems to only give me money so long as she can ridicule me daily for what a burden I am to merely keep alive. I doubt she seriously wants me to establish a career which would permanently improve my lifestyle and render her obsolete. Thankfully, kind people do exist (and they do not require me to be perfect to exist).</p>
<p>I will do my best to make the most of every day I get. Lastly, I apologize if I offend anyone. It is almost inevitable that I will, so I might as well use the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/infinite_loop_sound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INFINITE_LOOP_SOUND</a> application to replay a sound file of me saying, &#8220;I am sorry&#8221; on a computer hooked up to an endless power supply!</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Whether or not I have a job, I intend to make the most of my &#8220;free time&#8221; (and that includes software development, especially). I am not sure if I will get hired any time soon. Nevertheless, I am trying to get a part-time job so I can earn at least as much money as what I have been getting as gifts reluctantly given to me by my mother. I just want to minimize the stress and stagnancy of my life. It is too late for me to pretend that I was just born out of a test tube one day prior. Whether or not the vast majority of humans think I am mentally ill or not (or deserving of punishment or not), I am very motivated to make myself happy. Otherwise, I would plan my suicide.</p>
