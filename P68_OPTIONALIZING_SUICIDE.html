OPTIONALIZING_SUICIDE

S: "If I could, I would make suicide legal and, also, instantiate special clinics within every major hospital (or in a separate building) such that any human being aged 16 or older is permitted to undergo a minimally painful physician-assisted suicide without having to make an appointment and on the same day as arriving at the hospital (and without having to get another human being's approval nor acknowledgement that such a procedure is being implemented). I believe that a human being aged 16 years or older deserves to be treated as the sole custodian of its own life. Therefore, such a person should be allowed to cleanly and swiftly end its life (and be given knowledge in public schools that such am option is available since such an option would likely reduce the chance that a person would opt for suicide)."

T: "Why do you suggest that telling young people that they have the unconditional right to undergo a confidential and speedy physician-assisted suicide would reduce the occurrence of suicide in general? Why not just shame those youths into being stoic little soldiers who hold onto dear life until their circumstances spontaneously improve?"

S: "By forcing suicidal people to stay alive when they would prefer to commit suicide (for any whatever reason (including mental illness and ignorance)), such people inevitably spread their misery to others and, hence, impede societal progress because the dead weight of the suicidal ones holds everyone else back. Therefore, the dead weights should be allowed to delete themselves so that resources are not squandered on those who are decidedly not able or willing to adequately appreciate such a bounty."

T: "Why not incarcerate suicidal people inside of psychiatric institutions such that those people are bullied into forcing themselves to dance to the schematic their so-called 'loved ones' and fellow community members insist they dance to?"

S: "My life is not your life, T. Likewise, your life is not my life. Therefore, I cannot hold you hostage by demanding that you stay alive for me just as you cannot demand that I stay alive for you."

T: "Wrong! If I have a gun and you do not, I can hold a gun up to your body and threaten to maim and torture you unless you dance according to the schematic I want you to (or I can notify weapon-baring authorities to torture you into compliance)."

S: "Thanks for showing me how impossible it is to legalize suicide in a society run by control freaks who demand that everyone dance the way control freaks want them to. Now I am more convinced than ever that the only way to commit suicide is to jump off of a very tall object (such that my body is sure to explode into smithereens once it hits the ground (and I presumably would not have time to register the pain of such a collision because my death would be instantaneous))."

T: "I will make sure that security guards surround you and incapacitate you as soon as the ubiquitous surveillance networks (which make your otherwise private thoughts known to the authorities) detect that you are implementing your suicide plan."

S: "We would literally need to test that in real life."

T: "Game on! You will dance the way I want you to. You will be prevented from committing suicide."

S: "Like I said, you would need to prove that you have such authority over my life (and not someone else's life). Perhaps I am immune to your authority and I will kill myself even while you demand that I do otherwise."
