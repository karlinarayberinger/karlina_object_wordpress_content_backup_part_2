Hypothesis: AP (a former intimate partner and coworker of mine) hired someone to place a body-mind surveillance/flow-control device inside my body without my knowledge or consent such that AP can anonymously and remotely exploit such technology to micromanage me such that (a) I am committed to a mental hospital or jail for the rest of my life or (b) rushed into a relationship in which I am some chauvinist control freak's subordinate so that AP can relax knowing that I will never be able to out perform him at whatever scarcity-driven, prestige-oriented career, locale, and social position AP aspires to obtain and to maintain. I think that every person I know would suggest that I am insane or abusive just for publishing this hypothesis. I also think most of them would play dumb for AP's benefit and at my expense because they think AP is more deserving of career and lifestyle satisfaction than I am.
