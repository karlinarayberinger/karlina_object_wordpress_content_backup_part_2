<p>AGAINST_SUBORDINATION</p>
<hr>
<p>Hypothesis: AP (a former intimate partner and coworker of mine) hired someone to place a body-mind surveillance/flow-control device inside my body without my knowledge nor consent such that AP can anonymously and remotely exploit such technology to micromanage me such that (a) I am either committed to a mental hospital or jail for the rest of my life or else (b) rushed into a relationship in which I am some chauvinist control freak&#8217;s subordinate so that AP can relax knowing that I will never be able to out perform him at whatever scarcity-driven, prestige-oriented career, locale, and social position AP aspires to obtain and to maintain.</p>
<p>I think that every person I know would suggest that I am insane or abusive just for publishing this hypothesis. I also think most of them would play dumb for AP&#8217;s benefit and at my expense because they think AP is more deserving of career and lifestyle satisfaction than I am. That is because sexism seems to be so normalized that it is enforced as though it were an immutable part of the human condition forevermore (and without heeding the possibility that transhuman evolution is possible (and transhuman evolution literally means that humans meld with computers such that the humanoid result is a new kind of species which can live orders of magnitude longer than humans currently do and have expanded physical and mental abilities)).</p>
<p>For instance, I have been told by many female (and Latin American) coworkers at the factory jobs I worked at that it is not okay for a woman to walk alone or to be outside alone in general and that I should always have an escort or group to accompany me at all times (which is why I think that women relegated to such lowly positions in the socioeconomic matrix tend to default into being &#8220;family first&#8221; types rather than intellectuals (because <span style="background:#ffff00;">being a successful intellectual type requires plenty of solitude and independence of mind to really make a dent in the universe</span>).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Sometimes I think people (especially women) are conditioned to think that they need more intellectual assistance from other people than they actually do (particularly when it comes to innovation and problem-solving in general).</span> That is why I am not interested in presenting myself as a &#8220;feminist&#8221; (i.e. a person who specializes in promoting the human rights of women in particular with the implied context that women are inherently fighting an uphill battle more than men are). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I would rather just call myself a &#8220;humanist&#8221; because I would rather treat human beings as unique and irreplaceable <em>individuals</em> which each deserve the <em>same</em> set of fundamental human rights.</span> I do not like insinuating that certain classifications of being human imply that such people have innate (or culturally indoctrinated) limitations which <em>require</em> a &#8220;professional&#8217;s&#8221; assistance to help them overcome.</p>
<p>According to chauvinist culture: As long as a woman pleases the most dominant male of her household, she apparently is doing her job. She must not make him feel insecure. Hence, she convinces herself that she does not mind suppressing her <span style="background:#ffff00;">individualistic</span> ambitions and focusing on taking care of other people as her primary means for garnering a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Needless to say, <span style="background:#ffff00;">I want to remain maritally single, childless, a household of exactly one person, and someone who can afford to live comfortably making a living working remotely.</span> I am disgusted by those who demand that I let AP or someone else be the gatekeeper to my own mind and body (such that myself and other people literally need to be approved by that gatekeeper to interact with me).</p>

<p>One more note: while walking around in Dublin, California, I noticed an advertisement which said something like &#8220;In Dublin, everyone is Irish!&#8221; What I think that seemingly lighthearted message intended to imply was that each and every human being (regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, ability level, and even criminal status) deserve to be treated as first-class citizens. I condone such an interpretation wholeheartedly.</p>
