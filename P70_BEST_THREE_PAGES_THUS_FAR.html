<p>BEST_THREE_PAGES_THUS_FAR</p>
<hr>
<p>As of today, what I consider to be the best three pages of this website are pinned at the top of my Minds dot Com content list (username: <a href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_0: <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/pi_approximation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PI_APPROXIMATION</a>.</p>
<p>This is my favorite JavaScript web page application thus far because it demonstrates how to implement timed animations, geometry, and it shows how integer ratios can be used to approximate quantities which are impossible to represent as a finite sequence of digits (and that approximation generally becomes more accurate the larger the integer input set becomes).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_1: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/maximum_individual_freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAXIMUM_INDIVIDUAL_FREEDOM</a>.</p>
<p>I like this page because the imaginary characters S and T demonstrate what I feel is an ideal kind of friendship. Also, I like how they elaborate on the kinds of utopian ideals I proposed and how S and T referred to me as some character which they supposedly could interact with on a peer-to-peer level (even though I essentially made S and T out of my imagination (which makes me sort of god-like with respect to each S and T)).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_2: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/utopian_ideals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTOPIAN_IDEALS</a>.</p>
<p>This list of propositions is a succinct list of specific ways human civilization can be significantly improved. In particular, the list emphasizes a switch to 100% pollution-free energy sources, the outsourcing of most labor to robots, and the extended longevity and functionality of human bodies using stem cells to grow replacement body parts.</p>
