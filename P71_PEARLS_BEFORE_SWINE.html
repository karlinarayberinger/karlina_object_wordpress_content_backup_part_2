<p>PEARLS_BEFORE_SWINE</p>
<hr>
<p>I created this website on 03_APRIL_2020. Since then, I have revised this website many times; particularly by removing pages which I thought were superfluous or immature-sounding.</p>
<p>Last night, I considered removing pages from this blog in order to make the overall content less political and more scientific, but after further consideration, I decided to keep all 70 pages prior to this one included in the blog. Even though some of that content is depressingly raunchy, anthropocentric, and unprofessional, I decided that I am better off keeping that content preserved permanently on the most up-to-date index page of the website so that I do not have to repeat myself in future posts. To be clear, I did not enjoy writing about sexism, anti-futurist cultures, and the way I feel generally ignored and sometimes censored by humans who seem to be opposed to my agenda to promote a worldwide artificially intelligent technocracy in place of elected human politicians, pollution-free energy production in place of ecologically-destructive energy production, laboratory-grown and institution-raised humans instead of human pregnancy and nuclear family households, and other topics which generally amount to one thesis: maximizing individual freedom and power for each and every person is infinitely more important to me than is accommodating the chauvinist and anti-intellectual cultural norms which seem to prevail because almost every human being seems conditioned by society to indefinitely postpone the kinds of progressive measures I am impatient to see implemented as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.</p>
<p>I have felt pangs of malaise while composing most of the pages prior to this one because I have metaphorically felt that I am casting pearls before swine (or attempting to inspire mere dogs to be interested in learning calculus (and not just to please some master and to get a reward from master)). I cannot help but conclude that the vast majority of humans which coexist on Planet Earth with me are indifferent to the projects I am interested in devoting the rest of my life to mostly because what I want to focus on does not pertain to show biz, blind and instant gratification of base appetites, celebrity worship, and sensationalist media mongering.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">At worst, this website will only really be appreciated by myself. Even in that case, I would greatly appreciate having this blog to call my lifelong friend and keeper of the milestones I have reached as an intellectual.</span> At best, my blog will be viewed by many people and those who read it will be changed in a positive way as a result. I doubt very many people are going to care about this blog even 0.0001% as much as I do (even so-called friends and fans). That is because this blog is my baby. As the old adage goes, no human loves a human more than its own mother supposedly does.</p>
<p>Needless to say, not everything I say is absolutely factually accurate (though, at the time of writing, I intend to capture my sincere emotions and thoughts as succinctly and as articulately as possible). I therefore implore readers to be skeptical about everything they take in as informational input (or as cognitive throughput). In other words, one is not necessarily obligated to believe every thought which one thinks.</p>
