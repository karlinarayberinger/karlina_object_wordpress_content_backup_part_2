THERAPUTIC_VIOLENCE

<hr>

Today, while entering the California State University East Bay (Hayward, California) campus from a scenic hiking trail which I have frequented many times, I was talking via subvocal recognition technology to "the ghost person" about how that person's actual body was housed inside of a floatation tank while hooked up to some kind of augmented reality brain-to-computer interface which allowed that person to remotely inhabit my body and communicate with me telepathically. The ghost person also mentioned that my Teva sports sandals are much better for my feet than were those pinchy work shoes which seemed to deform my feet and cause me to not walk as efficiently, comfortably, and far. In other words, it seemed that the ghost and I were starting to pick up the pieces on how "normal" society seems to maim people into being less physically healthy and active than they would otherwise be. I was enjoying our conversation until a pitbull stared me down and immediately started attacking me (while the tall male owner of the man was positioned about five feet away).

The dog bit me about three times and caused a bloody gash to form in my right thigh. (Hopefully, the wound will not develop into an infection). The guy was able to get the dog on a leash, but my intuition tells me that the dog attack was a planned (undercover) "police brutality" exercise to scare me into not being so naive about how fucked up the world is.

Humans share more than 99% of their DNA with chimpanzees (and chimpanzees are notorious for being extremely violent animals who routinely rape the females and savagely kill anyone who threates their sense of terriroty ownership). I sure hope the transhumanist revolution launches before the end of my lifetime. I would love to see the humans meld with machines and upgrade their bodies, DNA, and minds such that they eliminate those unnecessarily savage qualities which too many bimbos stil find too sexually attractive (for hypergamous reasons) to not want to make babies with. If I could, I would sterilize all the humans and only allow new humans to be minted through stem cells inside of artificial wombs (or in the wombs of healthy surrogate female human volunteers).

Until then, I will be extra cautious around humans in general (because they are not that different from chimpanzees; especially when their sense of territory is threatened (and I am unusually independent for a female human, which seems to make some men (and women) want to inflict harm on my body because they do not like how I have not given into some human's demand for sex in exchange for protection and provisions)).
