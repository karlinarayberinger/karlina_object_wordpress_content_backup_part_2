THERAPUTIC_VIOLENCE

<hr>

Today, while entering the California State University East Bay (Hayward, California) campus from a scenic hiking trail which I have frequented many times, I was talking via subvocal recognition technology to "the ghost person" about how that person's actual body was housed inside of a floatation tank while hooked up to some kind of augmented reality brain-to-computer interface which allowed that person to remotely inhabit my body and communicate with me telepathically. The ghost person also mentioned that my Teva sports sandals are much better for my feet than were those pinchy work shoes which seemed to deform my feet and cause me to not walk as efficiently, comfortably, and far. In other words, it seemed that the ghost and I were starting to pick up the pieces on how "normal" society seems to maim people into being less physically healthy and active than they would otherwise be.
