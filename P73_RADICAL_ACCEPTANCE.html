<p>RADICAL_ACCEPTANCE</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Reality (i.e. Nature) is exactly one particular way; a single container of multiple objects; a beholder of all changes; the source and destination of all transmissions. Its irreducible essence is the <strong>undefined</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I choose to accept reality exactly as it is,&#8221; is my new mantra. It was prescribed to me by angelic fairies in some dream I had. The fairies said it would minimize the suffering associated with my existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; is another weird mantra I would tell myself because it instantly reminds me that the present moment is the only time in which I actually able to exert some degree of agency. The locus of control is in the here and now (wherever and however I am an embodied entity). <span style="background:#ffff00;">If and when my body dies, I might get reincarnated inside of a new body or else be completely undefined and, therefore, as ubiquitous as Nature itself.</span></p>

<p>A cautionary message&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The unaugmented human brain is notorious for tricking the consciousness which inhabits it into believing the extremely convincing delusional perceptions and beliefs that brain generates.</span> Such delusions help to simplify an otherwise complicated brain-to-environment interface in order to maximize the likelihood that the body which houses that brain will survive rather than die before passing on its genes to the next generation of bodies.</p>
<p>As a corollary, some human beings either intentionally or unintentionally insist on only selectively accepting reality as it is by denying that any alternative to one&#8217;s own preferred ideology and recited narratives for explaining how past events occurred exists.</p>
<p>For example, I could say that I witnessed a tree falling down to someone who was not a direct witness to what I claim to have witnessed and that person could say, &#8220;I did not see the tree fall down. Therefore, the tree did not fall down. You are just imaging things that are not real because you are mentally ill. I desperately need to believe that you are mentally ill so that I can dismiss the things you say which I do not find convenient for my self-centered agenda. I am free to believe that I am the most omniscient being in all existence. You cannot stop me from promoting any belief I want. Haha! I win! You lose! Now you cannot talk to me without having to accommodate my religion (and it is my basic human right to believe whatever I want and to exploit it for all it is worth).&#8221;</p>
<p>All I can say to such people to minimize suffering for all parties is insincere sycophantic words of affirmation such as, &#8220;Okee dokee,&#8221; and, &#8220;Whatever you say,&#8221; (which both essentially mean: &#8220;You can say, do, and think however you apparently want to because, just like me, you are a puppet of a deterministic universe in which free will is probably illusory for our evolutionary convenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would elaborate to suggest that such a person is implicitly using the &#8220;insanity clause&#8221; to insinuate that it cannot be expected to do much other than lie and feign disability in order to avoid being treated as culpable for its own decisions with respect to society (since &#8220;free will&#8221; (which is synonymous with culpability) exists as a virtual personal attribute within the virtual reality simulation that is human society).</p>
<p>To cope with someone who insists on wielding the insanity clause to escape social responsibility and intellectual credibility, I simply apply the mantra of radical acceptance: <span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;I choose to accept reality exactly as it is (and reality can only be exactly one way: the way it is now).&#8221;</span></p>
