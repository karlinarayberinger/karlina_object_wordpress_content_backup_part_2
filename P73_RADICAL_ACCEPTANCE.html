RADICAL_ACCEPTANCE

<hr>

Reality is exactly one particular way; a single container of multiple objects; a beholder of all changes. 

"I choose to accept reality exactly as it is," is my new mantra. It was prescribed to me by angelic fairies in some dream I had. The fairies said it would minimize the suffering associated with my existence. 

"This is it," is another weird mantra I would tell myself because it instantly reminds me that the present moment is the only time in which I actually able to exert some degree of agency. The locus of control is in the here and now (wherever and however I am an embodied entity). If and when my body dies, I might get reincarnated inside of a new body and/or be completely undefined and, therefore, ubiquitous as Nature.
