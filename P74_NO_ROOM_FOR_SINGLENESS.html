<strong>Background Context:</strong>

In the spring of the year 2019, I remember working on computer science applications in my bedroom at my father's house (which is and was my legal residence). I was enjoying myself and basking in the morning sunlight coming through my window, sipping on coffee, listening to Internet classical radio stations, and studying whatever I wanted to study at my leisure until my father started throwing wordless tantrums in protest of my productivity, solitude, and happiness. He tried to interrupt me by standing outside my bedroom window while spraying poisonous Round-Up pesticide, saying sarcastic remarks about how apparently friendless I was, and essentially suggesting that I was as obsolete in the workforce as he was. In short, I believe that he is and was pathologically envious of my ambition and interest in solitary intellectual pursuits while all he seemed to do with his time was "quietly" rage at how I was not treating him like my best friend and child. (Of course, my mother has dismissed what I have had to say and she seems to want me to just settle for being a stay-at-home, misery-loves-company, agoraphobic, antiquated, under-educated slave to both her and my father so that they had me as their companion at their convenience at all times). That is why I have resorted to living outside of Castro Valley (the town in which both my parents live) like a vagrant (but really as a computer science student slowly but surely laying down the pieces of my lifestyle's infrastructure so that I can sustain the chaos of reality and expedite my progress towards permanently moving out of my parents' household and sustaining a fulfilling lifestyle). Right now, I am making arrangements to get some kind of income other than my mother's deliberately insufficient cash donations (which she only seems to give to me if I suffer as much as she wants me to). I do not intend to incriminate my parents or myself, but I do want to suggest that my family and I are part of some wild west comedy-drama which "necessarily" has to play out as it has, is, and will for the sake of helping to diagnose and permanently resolve larger infrastructural problems which are relevant to human civilization at large.
