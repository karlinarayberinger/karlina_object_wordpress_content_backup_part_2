NO_ROOM_FOR_SINGLENESS

<strong>Background Context:</strong>

In the spring of the year 2019, I remember working on computer science applications in my bedroom at my father's house (which is and was my legal residence). I was enjoying myself and basking in the morning sunlight coming through my window, sipping on coffee, listening to Internet classical radio stations, and studying whatever I wanted to study at my leisure until my father started throwing wordless tantrums in protest of my productivity, solitude, and happiness. He tried to interrupt me by standing outside my bedroom window while spraying poisonous Round-Up pesticide, saying sarcastic remarks about how apparently friendless I was, and essentially suggesting that I was as obsolete in the workforce as he was. In short, I believe that he is and was pathologically envious of my ambition and interest in solitary intellectual pursuits while all he seemed to do with his time was "quietly" rage at how I was not treating him like my best friend and child. (Of course, my mother has dismissed what I have had to say and she seems to want me to just settle for being a stay-at-home, misery-loves-company, agoraphobic, antiquated, under-educated slave to both her and my father so that they had me as their companion at their convenience at all times). That is why I have resorted to living outside of Castro Valley (the town in which both my parents live) like a vagrant (but really as a computer science student slowly but surely laying down the pieces of my lifestyle's infrastructure so that I can sustain the chaos of reality and expedite my progress towards permanently moving out of my parents' household and sustaining a fulfilling lifestyle). Right now, I am making arrangements to get some kind of income other than my mother's deliberately insufficient cash donations (which she only seems to give to me if I suffer as much as she wants me to). I do not intend to incriminate my parents or myself, but I do want to suggest that my family and I are part of some wild west comedy-drama which "necessarily" has to play out as it has, is, and will for the sake of helping to diagnose and permanently resolve larger infrastructural problems which are relevant to human civilization at large.

<strong>False Scarcity Dilemma:</strong>

A few years ago, my mother was willing to give me roughly as much spending money as she does now (although that is arguable) and in cash form rather than via PayPal deposits (and it took my mother a long time to finally agree to send me money via PayPal instead of going to my bedroom to collect "random" cash drop-offs. (My mother gave my father that cash to give to me at his leisure such that I had little to no say over the timing and the amount of each of those deposits seemingly in order to train me to be Daddy's Little Girl in an outdated and sexist simulation of what a family is). That is not even the worst of the situation as far as I can tell. I shall explain the biggest crux of the problem...

As long as I relied on my mother's petroleum-powered Toyota Matrix automobile to get around, my mother was eager to fill the tank as often as possible using her debit and/or credit card. When I insisted on relying on green commute methods only (especially walking), I see that my mother did not want to pay for my lifestyle unless I was on the brink of starvation and barely able to maintain what little of a lifestyle I had. What I think is going on right now is that my mother is getting ready to cut me off economic support before I have the means to support myself so that I end up permanently destitute. That is the biggest stressor of my life. Rather than let that stressor stahl my progress towards my career and artistic goals, I shall milk the situation for all it is worth by using it as fodder for blog content.

<strong>Coerced Into Staying Perpetually Distraught:</strong>

Back when I was more willing to try establishing a self-paced online learning curriculum in order to eventually get hired as a full-time software engineer, my father initially sounded supportive of such aspirations until I actual started getting immersed in what I was doing (and it was not exactly accommodating of my father's sense of entitlement to my time, attention, and body). 

My father and his "hired" tenant used to play loud music past midnight as though they secretly had an agenda to deprive me of a morning routine so that I would adapt to their circadian rhythms. I even heard the tenant claim that he had no interest in office work and that he only wanted to take disabled people out on dates as his primary income source. I also heard him say that he would not let me compile a single line of code in his midst (or possibly even ever). What I think has been going on is that my father wanted to make his household an old boy's club only and to deliberately make me feel outnumbered, suffocated, and prevented from making progress with my desired career goals so that so that I would remain destitute and miserable. 

I do not understand why there is so much animosity against me. I find it hard to believe that it is all a result of mere chauvinism or jealousy of my youthfulness, freedom, and talents. I think that many people think I deserve to be punished more harshly for the crimes which I was convicted of in the past. Hence, such people resort to inflicting as much harm on me as they can get away with. 

I would not be surprised if such people get sexually aroused by seeing women (especially powerful women) get abused and disenfranchised. I see how such people seem to demand that I settle for identifying as a prostitute or, at the very least, some guy's girlfriend.

For me to want to remain single (i.e. not someone else's romantic, sexual, or domestic partner) is apparently a radical act. Apparently, single adulthood is what most people secretly want but cannot afford. Hence, I am deprived of economic support as a consequence of not wanting to tether myself to other people in an economically and ideologically codependent living situation.

The hostility I seem to be the recipient of as a result of insisting on remaining single and childless is so bad that cyber cops have essentially "married" (or "adopted") me against my will in order to control how I think, perceive, and behave (for everyone's safety). I do my best to be gender neutral while other humans seem to insist that I defer to being much more feminized than I want to be just to prevent people from wanting to inflict harm on me (like what happened last night when some dude unapologetically released his pitbull on me while ladies across the street seemed to be watching in anticipation of an epic blood-bath showdown. See THERAPEUTIC_VIOLENCE for details. Yes, I believe that I was set up to be mauled by a pitbull in order to satisfy the sadistic chauvinist residents who wanted to scare me into being some whipped pussy while men strut around with their lackeys and weapons (because that is what keeps the ghetto population churning). Yes, I think most ghetto women are terrorized into getting pregnant just to earn their keep in a brutish male-dominated world. That is just a part of Hispanic culture. I am apparently criminally racist for expressing this train of thought. Hence, I might get gang attacked again while everyone around me seems to be apathetic to my plight).
