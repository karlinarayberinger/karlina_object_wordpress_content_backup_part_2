GHETTO_EPITAPH

The pitbull people are a miserable bunch. They trample over flowers and turn them to mush. They scare away the colors which leaves the land awash in ashen gray. They threaten to take away the light of day unless it is them you pay. 

Feed the endless war machine greed. Make the special snowflakes bleed so that there is nothing left to grieve. Just nonchalant figures swaggering listlessly in haughty tepid dreams. 

Make a mockery of the now and zen. Keep thoughts placid as sedated pigs in a pen. All who seem to matter are poor working class men.

All females are brides; otherwise their hands are tied (to posts of brothel beds in order to be fed just to be sent out as too damaged to wed). 

Children are token chattel which are raised on tortured cattle. They are raised to treat all animals as mere chattel. So I hear the jail cage rattle.

I wish that the entire (human) world would adopt my sensibilities as a vegan, environmentally conscious, holistic health valuing, trans-speciest sentient, egalitarian, nonviolent communication promoting, censorship adverse, human-machine-interface evolution enabling, scientifically inquisitive, genuinely open minded, conscious expanding, and individuality promoting species overnight and wake up to restart human civilization on much more secure and joyous grounding. Even though such a wish is quite idealistic and unlikely to manifest, expressing that wish here makes it more likely to come true (at least in increments).
