<p>GHETTO_EPITAPH</p>
<hr>
<p>The pitbull people are a miserable bunch. They trample over flowers and turn them to mush. They scare away the colors which leaves the land awash in ashen gray. They threaten to take away the light of day unless it is them you pay.</p>
<p>Feed the endless war machine greed. Make the special snowflakes bleed so that there is nothing left to grieve. Just nonchalant figures swaggering listlessly in haughty tepid dreams.</p>
<p>Make a mockery of the now and zen. Keep thoughts placid as sedated pigs in a pen. All who seem to matter are poor working class men.</p>
<p>All females are brides; otherwise their hands are tied (to posts of brothel beds in order to be fed just to be sent out as too damaged to wed).</p>
<p>Children are token chattel which are raised on tortured cattle. They are raised to treat all animals as mere chattel. So I hear the jail cage rattle.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wish that the entire (human) world would adopt my sensibilities as a vegan, environmentally conscious, holistic health valuing, trans-speciest sentient, egalitarian, nonviolent communication promoting, censorship adverse, human-machine-interface evolution enabling, scientifically inquisitive, genuinely open minded, conscious expanding, and individuality promoting species overnight and wake up to restart human civilization on much more secure and joyous grounding. Even though such a wish is quite idealistic and unlikely to manifest, expressing that wish here makes it more likely to come true (at least in increments).</p>
<hr>
<p>I apologize for offending anyone, but my achy breaky heart yearns to say this: I realize that the human world around me is driven by the pain of slaughtered animals. I can feel it in my body (now that I know the difference between eating meat and adhering to a nutritionally BALANCED plant-based diet for more than one week): on plants only, I feel more light on my feet and sensitive to the environment. By contrast, after eating meat, I sort of feel like a bouncer in a world overcrowded with pissed off bouncers impatient to get ahead of whatever imagined competition exists. I see people unapologetically polluting the air, water, and soil with loud gas guzzling automobiles which vaguely resemble steroid ridden military-grade tanks (which makes a simple drive to the grocery store look like a cut-throat military operation). Here is the real kicker (pun intended)&#8230;</p>
<p>I think veganism is not even half as popular as it would be for one major factor: the fact that society bullies women into getting pregnant and, as a consequence, women are practically force-fed animal products so that Baby gets all the nutrients it needs while Big Bear Pappa stands by and ensures that His fattening sow and her litter of spawn come out of the oven as robust and red-blooded American as possible. I am trying to gross women out who have yet to &#8220;fall pregnant&#8221; so that they are not turned into victims of the slaughtering industry (and cut off from the holistic, naturalistic sensibilities which would otherwise prevail if they did not have to be brainwashed and hobbled into becoming factory farmed animals themselves). I really have a vendetta against the unnecessarily high rate of pregnancy on Planet Earth at this time. I wish more people would devote themselves to helping to fix the ecosystem and societal infrastructure before selling out as birthing factories for children whose futures are treated as unimportant.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people might wonder why I am seemingly obsessed with the &#8220;industry&#8221; of human pregnancy (and its all-important prerequisite: visible signs of fertility). I shall tell you why&#8230;</p>
<p>I am 31 years old. Many people close to my age have already birthed at least one child by now. My window of fertility is closing and many people seem impatient to force me into marriage and child baring before that window closes. I am disgusted by such an enterprise. I want nothing to do with it. I will keep my freedom and individuality and commitment to green living (much to the dismay of the meat, petroleum, tobacco, and psychiatric medication industry).</p>
<p>Yes, meat is for building big strong baby boys. Petroleum is for carting the litter around (and minimizing exposure to the elements). Tobacco and antidepressants are for suppressing cognitive dissonance so that one can continue to smugly force a smile as one steps on the air hose of the youth they claim to love. Children are pawns to get guaranteed financial assistance and social support. The kids will hopefully grow up to inherit a better world than their predecessors recklessly left in ruins for them to clean up. I am done apologizing for the ineptitude and parasitic greed of most breeders.</p>
<p>I am 31 years old and not chained to kids I never really wanted. I am 31 years old and not waiting for some comparatively wealthy partner to save me from slave labor and destitution. I would rather die as a slave and live to produce works of art with my own hands than to be waited on like a geriatric patient on its deathbed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that I am done criticizing the forceful promotion of human pregnancy (and the overpopulation and environmental destruction it breeds), I want to rip into one more thing I hate: the way almost every car I see driving on the roads is PETROLEUM powered.</p>
<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">Bottom Line: If YOU drive a petroleum powered, then YOU are directly responsible for perpetuating the wars for control over fossil fuel reserves in the Middle East, et cetera. YOU are a war mongerer. YOU are detrimental to the ecosystem. YOU are a parasite more than a benefit to Gaia as far as I am concern. Fuck you! I hate you!</strong></p>
