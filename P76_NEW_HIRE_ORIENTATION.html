NEW_HIRE_ORIENTATION

<hr>

R: "Every moment is a new beginning. Every day is a fresh start. Just stay humble, work hard, and be nice and good things will happen to you."

S: "Those are uplifting words of advice. Thank you for sharing them."

T: "I have some objections to what R said."

R: "Please share them with the group, T. We can all learn from each other."

T: "Firstly, I do not believe that every moment is a new beginning nor that every day is a fresh start unless I have amnesia. Secondly, I have a contention with your advice of being humble because it sounds like euphemism for downplaying my professionalism in order to prevent less professional persons from feeling so insecure that they resort to antagonism (because they are a bunch of unprofessional communists). Lastly, while I agree that one should always work hard and strive to be nice, I doubt that being on my best behavior will guarantee that events will play out in my favor."

R: "Thank you for sharing, T. Your feedback is appreciated. Now it is time to play an ice breaker game and continue with the new hires day one checklist."

P: "I do not like how T has to be such an arrogant prick."

R: "Please refrain from using vulgar language, P. Thank you, P, for sharing your thoughts. We can all learn from each other. Now, let us begin the ice breaker game. I will read aloud each new hire's name from the list and ask each of you to share your favorite ice cream flavor and pick a number at random."

Random Inclusion...

If you do not own a car, then you are a bum; not a person. A bum is a piece of trash on the side of the road. A person is clean, pristine, fresh, and ready to engage in retail exchanges, entertainment, and family-friendly recreation. Bums must get out of the way so that the well-kept ones do not have to be reminded of their lowly existence.

Another Random Inclusion...

Just because I was laying down (in a secluded spot out of everyone's way), some people at school got mad and called the campus police to have me kicked out. I heard the man complaining that he did not like seeing me laying down. This is not the first time some irritable man called the cops on me just for looking relaxed. It seems that no one is allowed to sit down and do anything contemplative on campus unless one makes extraordinary efforts to hide. Also, some one vandalized my laptop charging cord seemingly to make me feel violated, stolen from, and prevented from being able to partake in my craft. Needless to say, I have never had a lower opinion on Hispanics. I feel that they have turned Hayward into a cesspool of toxic waste and CSUEB into a Republican sanctuary where no one is allowed to do anything but move around like headless chickens. Oh well! Back to being the token Nazi!

Until Hispanics stop acting like brainwashed, moralistic, violence-mongering, anti free-speech children who have to hide behind some weapon-wielding thug, I want nothing to do with their medieval culture. (Of course I know not every Hispanic is that primitive . Those who are not would not be offended by this criticism because it obviously does not apply to them).

While I want to get back to making uninterrupted progress on my software engineering career goals, I am fighting an uphill battle against the tyranny of anti-intellectual, militaristic, violent, environmentally reckless, and uncompassionate savages who seem to want to hold humanity back in terms of its collective evolution so that the whole biosphere corrodes into a poisonous waste dump full of "intellectually disabled" savages. (At the moment of this writing they are gang stalking me and trying to deprive me of breathing room. They use their kids as meat shields while trying to taunt me into conflict I am desperately trying to avoid getting roped into just so they can have me detained and locked up in a cage).

Public Service Announcement...

Little girls; I am not your rainbow unicorn princess mascot. Little boys; I am not your military tough guy action figure. Women; I am not your wayward Bible studies group sheep. Men; I am neither your violence-promoting competitor nor your brothel whore plaything. Humans; I am not your living pinata nor your scapegoat nor your maid nor your nurse. I cannot clean up the messes you leave faster than you make them. You are turning my planet into your fecal matter ridden waste dump. I am sick of your cloistering greed, stench, and poison peddling. I want nothing more than to rid the world of your destruction (or at the very least, to live such that I am safe from your whorish meddling, downtrodden vibes, and destructive interference with my otherwise peaceful, intellectually rich, and environmentally sustainable lifestyle). I have too much of my life sabotaged by strangers who do not seem to want me to enjoy even the simplest pleasures. Your suffocating greed and antagonism is the source of at least 95% of my total suffering.

Ghetto Epitaph Final Puzzle Piece...

P: "It is not okay for you to smile or laugh genuinely. It is only okay for you to hold a Mona Lisa expression of tepid contentment at whatever life throws at you. Be humble, be demure, and be nonchalant about your life of menial chores and blandly familial smalltalk. Otherwise, you will remain worse than unemployed. You will be deprived of privacy, health, safety, pride, and opportunities to improve your plight. So suck my cock or get kicked to the curb. The choice is yours...until I decide it is too late for you to be redeemed. In that case, I have nothing to say do you but 'good luck' while not sincerely wanting good things to happen to you."

Q: "Are you done with me?"

P: "No. I will spend the rest of my life hiring people to ruthlessly terrorize and disenfranchise you. You are not a member of Mi Famalia. You deserve neither mercy nor compassion nor satisfaction. Goodbye and good luck."

BIGGEST_REDDEST_FLAG...

Why am I, Karlina Ray Beringer, not at my legal residence? Would it not be easier to simply hunker down their and make do with what I have while under the eternally watchful eye of my parents, neighbors, and law enforcement in a "safe" enclosure away from the thugs? 

The biggest deterrent to my "working from home" is the fact that antagonistic voices play in my brain against my will from the outside in which (a) distract me from intellectually rigorous thoughts and (b) which pummel my brain into literally atrophying such that my thoughts literally conform to making my father (and mother) feel that he (and she) are the center of my world. To this day not a single person has said that it believes what I say is actual technological brain interference and not just my brain hallucinating disembodied and infantilizing voices on its own. I suspect many people know about the technological brainwashing (which is functionally a lobotomy) yet seemingly not a single human being other than myself thus far has been willing or able to acknowledge the existence of such a phenomenon. (Also, I do not want to inhale the secondary cigarette smoke which lingers in the air in that house which everyone but me seems to be seriously bothered by). In short, I would much rather risk getting physically attacked by thugs and pit bulls, arrested by campus police, have my belongings stolen or vandalized, and otherwise bullied by people who do not want me to thrive in this world than to stay away from CSUEB just because the politically conservative conformists and anti-intellectuals want to deprive me of a livelihood I genuinely enjoy. I will fight for my right to thrive even if I am an army of exactly one. Otherwise, I might as well hide in the bushes somewhere and wait for the world to be less hostile to my agenda (which might take the rest of my life).

Further elaboration...

The area I legally live at seems to be heavily populated by affluent and politically conservative families with young children and elderly residents. I appear to be one of the few unmarried adults in that neighborhood and the only one in my age group. It is not a place for worldly millennials who enjoy being workaholics and politically liberal. Therefore, it is not a place for me to thrive. Every time I have attempted to make myself at home there, I felt ganged up on, smothered, ridiculed, and unwelcome. It is hard for me to relax there. (If I cannot relax, I cannot really do my best work). I seem to have better luck elsewhere (even outside in the bushes using only my phone for Internet and my laptop's battery for power). 

<hr>

Sometimes, it seems that, the more I show distress, the more I am attacked. Also, if I do not show enough distress, I am attacked such that I show distress. I am afraid to appear "too happy" or "too unhappy" as a result. It seems that I am not really allowed to exist as peacefully as I want to. It is a contradictory way to live. I am not sure how to continue on with my life without having to lower my expectations to an almost abysmal extent. Perhaps that is the "happiest" way to survive in a dysfunctional society.
