R: "Every moment is a new beginning. Every day is a fresh start. Just stay humble, work hard, and be nice and good things will happen to you."

S: "Those are uplifting words of advice. Thank you for sharing them."

T: "I have some objections to what R said."

R: "Please share them with the group, T. We can all learn from each other."

T: "Firstly, I do not believe that every moment is a new beginning nor that every day is a fresh start unless I have amnesia. Secondly, I have a contention with your advice of being humble because it sounds like euphemism for downplaying my professionalism in order to prevent less professional persons from feeling so insecure that they resort to antagonism (because they are a bunch of unprofessional communists). Lastly, while I agree that one should always work hard and strive to be nice, I doubt that being on my best behavior will guarantee that events will play out in my favor."

R: "Thank you for sharing, T. Your feedback is appreciated. Now it is time to play an ice breaker game and continue with the new hires day one checklist."

P: "I do not like how T has to be such an arrogant prick."

R: "Please refrain from using vulgar language, P. Thank you, P, for sharing your thoughts. We can all learn from each other. Now, let us begin the ice breaker game. I will read aloud each new hire's name from the list and ask each of you to share your favorite ice cream flavor and pick a number at random."
