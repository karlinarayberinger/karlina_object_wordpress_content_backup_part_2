DEFYING_THE_PATRIARCHY 

<hr>

Back when I was in high school, a physical science professor asked me if my father was a scientist simply because I seemed to have a higher-than-average knowledge of chemistry and physics for a student my age. The truth was that my father never worked a day in my life (and he only really worked as a food service worker and sign painter for a few years prior to becoming a full-time home maker while my mother was the sole income earner of my household while I was growing up until she retired from being a corporate bankruptcy lawyer in 2008). 

Since I was a young child I had a natural inclination to study natural science in my own time and with almost zero coaxing from any other person. When I got the chance to select a book to read from a shelf full of children's books during reading hour in elementary school, I almost always gravitated towards the illustrated science books. (I distinctly remember reading a book about neurons next to a boy reading a science book as well, and the teacher praised him for being interested in science but neglected to do the same for me).

While I was in elementary school, usually my brother was encouraged to be an engineer while I was encouraged to play with barbie dolls and fashion/beauty kits (which irked me to no end). Needless to say, I am appaled to this day how everyone around me seems to not believe that I am a self-made person and I did the bulk of the work of educating myself through self-study as a teenager and adult.

What I have noticed recently is that people seem aggessively pushy about making me stay in close proximity to my father and to rely on him for things I can do more competently on my own. For instance, each time I was incarerated at John George Psychiatric Paviolon after resorting to breaking objects (or committing physical assault) after feeling too angry, antagonized, ignored, lied to, and disenfrachised, I was not allowed to leave the hospital unless my father came to pick me up (even though I am in great hiking shape and could easily walk home since the hospital was within about a mile of my house).

What is creepy to me is that, since my mother's father moved into her house (at her insistance), my mother has made it her full-time "job" to use her father as an anchor for her identity while rarely leaving the house and progressively turning into a politically conversative shadow of her former self (and sadly, I have seen her intellectual and physical faculties decline sharply since her retirement; especially in recent years).

Likewise, I have watched my father turn into an exasperatingly politically conservative control freak since he was kicked out of my mother's house (by my mother after he failed to please her as well as her boyfriend did (and, of course, everyone accept for me seemed to be disturbed by the infidelity (and that boyfriend beat me up one time he found me in my mother's house after I was forbidden by her from being there)). Needless to say, I feel like the sanest and most honest person in my family (and out of everyone I have ever known across my entire lifespan).

So when people act incredulous that I could be my own parent better than either one of my parents (or former boyfriends) have, it leads me to assume that most people are sexist by default (i.e. most people think that girls need men to introduce them to "traditionally masculine" interests in order for those girls to actually retain such interests for the long term). I just happen to have an innate passion for science (which I may have inherrited from my paternal grandfather who was an electronics engineer who worked for Magnabox and who taught me about the "magic" of electromagnetism by demonstrating how to make magnets do amazing things without hardly saying a word).

Why all the daddy talk? As I write this at CSUEB, I see an overwhelming number of patriarchal people practically shoving this gender traditionalism down my throat everywhere I go. I rarely see women alone these days. Most of the women I see exude a lethargic vibe which suggests that they have adapted to spending most of their energy socializing and presenting themselves in ways which make them look subservient to males (even though I could be wrong about such superficial judgements (yet I doubt I am)). When I see a scientist, I usually know it because someone who genuinely enjoys science exudes an entirely different vibe; a kind of quiet intensity that suggests there is a lot of analysis going on beneath the surface and not so much of a "show biz" attire and flamboyance which I see in 90% of the girls around me.

I miss computer programming so much, it hurts. The reason why I am taking so long to get back into it is because, as soon as I start, I feel that I have to fight an uphill battle of cultural resistance and patriarchal normativity (and I fear that many people are trying to say that I am "unable" to succeed as a scientist or engineer unless I have some patriarch's blessing). Most notably, my mother has been very adament about suggesting that I apply for disability in order to get paid rather than to invest in my career (and she even said that it is okay to feign disability just so that I am not such a financial burden on her).

What is horrigying and infuriating to me is how adamament frequently and intensely other people have tried to destroy my innate love for science out of sheer jealousy, posessiveness over how I spend my time and energy, and the disgusting level of sexism I am practically choking on every day.

I really do not want to waste so much of this precious blog documenting the ugliness of humanity. I have tried to "reset", but every time I get a chance to actually sit down and focus, it seems that someone is impatiently waiting to kill my momentum such that I can never calm down enough to focus. Then they can diagnose me with a fake learning disability!

What I intend to do after this blog post is jump straight back into JavaScript programming whether or not it leads to a job because computer programming is something my soul misses. I do not want politics and social studies to interfere with my love of natural science, abstract logic, and analytical philosophy ever again.

One last thing: back when I was dating SD (and especially while dating AP), I felt terrorized into playing dumb in order to prevent my boyfriend from breaking up with me. It turns out that, no matter how hard I tried to be on my best behavior, I always ended up getting set up to feel disenfranchised simply because I was not willing to pretend to be much dumber than I actually am. That is part of why I am now almost entirely asexual, asocial, and disinterested in intimate relationships. I see that so much of humanity revolves around sex that it disturbs me. Someday (perhaps when I am much older and obviously "too old" to make babies, I will attract platonic friendships which revolve around common intellectual and spiritual interests rather than just "Netflix and Chill" monkey-see-monkey-do style bafoonery).
