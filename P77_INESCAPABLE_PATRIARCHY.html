INESCAPABLE_PATRIARCHY 

<hr>

Back when I was in high school, a physical science professor asked me if my father was a scientist simply because I seemed to have a higher-than-average knowledge of chemistry and physics for a student my age. The truth was that my father never worked a day in my life (and he only really worked as a food service worker and sign painter for a few years prior to becoming a full-time home maker while my mother was the sole income earner of my household while I was growing up until she retired from being a corporate bankruptcy lawyer in 2008). 

Since I was a young child I had a natural inclination to study natural science in my own time and with almost zero coaxing from any other person. When I got the chance to select a book to read from a shelf full of children's books during reading hour in elementary school, I almost always gravitated towards the illustrated science books. (I distinctly remember reading a book about neurons next to a boy reading a science book as well, and the teacher praised him for being interested in science but neglected to do the same for me).
