INESCAPABLE_PATRIARCHY 

<hr>

Back when I was in high school, a physical science professor asked me if my father was a scientist simply because I seemed to have a higher-than-average knowledge of chemistry and physics for a student my age. The truth was that my father never worked a day in my life (and he only really worked as a food service worker and sign painter for a few years prior to becoming a full-time home maker while my mother was the sole income earner of my household while I was growing up until she retired from being a corporate bankruptcy lawyer in 2008). 

Since I was a young child I had a natural inclination to study natural science in my own time and with almost zero coaxing from any other person. When I got the chance to select a book to read from a shelf full of children's books during reading hour in elementary school, I almost always gravitated towards the illustrated science books. (I distinctly remember reading a book about neurons next to a boy reading a science book as well, and the teacher praised him for being interested in science but neglected to do the same for me).

While I was in elementary school, usually my brother was encouraged to be an engineer while I was encouraged to play with barbie dolls and fashion/beauty kits (which irked me to no end). Needless to say, I am appaled to this day how everyone around me seems to not believe that I am a self-made person and I did the bulk of the work of educating myself through self-study as a teenager and adult.

What I have noticed recently is that people seem aggessively pushy about making me stay in close proximity to my father and to rely on him for things I can do more competently on my own. For instance, each time I was incarerated at John George Psychiatric Paviolon after resorting to breaking objects (or committing physical assault) after feeling too angry, antagonized, ignored, lied to, and disenfrachised, I was not allowed to leave the hospital unless my father came to pick me up (even though I am in great hiking shape and could easily walk home since the hospital was within about a mile of my house).

What is creepy to me is that, since my mother's father moved into her house (at her insistance), my mother has made it her full-time "job" to use her father as an anchor for her identity while rarely leaving the house and progressively turning into a politically conversative shadow of her former self (and sadly, I have seen her intellectual and physical faculties decline sharply since her retirement; especially in recent years).

Likewise, I have watched my father turn into an exasperatingly politically conservative control freak since he was kicked out of my mother's house (by my mother after he failed to please her as well as her boyfriend did (and, of course, everyone accept for me seemed to be disturbed by the infidelity (and that boyfriend beat me up one time he found me in my mother's house after I was forbidden by her from being there)). Needless to say, I feel like the sanest and most honest person in my family (and out of everyone I have ever known across my entire lifespan).
