After I got into a secure, comfortable, and quiet location to use my computer, my thoughts started to become more coherent than they were earlier today.

The "voices in my head" (which I am convinced are the result of technological telepathy beamed into my brain from some external source) gave me some suggestions for how to use this precious window of opportunity to get relevant research done. What they inspired me to do was listen to a specific noise generator app which features a looping and/or randomized sound track of people talking at the following Universal Resource Locator (URL):

<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/medievalVillageSoundscapeGenerator.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/medievalVillageSoundscapeGenerator.php</a>

I turned up the volume on just the track of voices talking in the marketplace and the track of the blacksmith banging on metal. 

(If I were hearing those kinds of sounds from their original sources and not merely through that noise generator application, I would probably be more stressed out by those sounds because of their immediacy (i.e. lack of separation between my body and the source of such sounds which the virtual simulator provides)).

The most interesting phenomenon I can report about listening to these sound recordings is the fact the way those sounds seem to be an anchor upon which the technologically telepathic voices seem to augment themselves onto; giving me the illusion that I am hearing personalized vocalized messages which sound as if they are part of the recorded vocalizations from the web app.

The kinds of personalized messages I am hearing are somewhat humorous, relevant to my specifically personal memories and recent concerns, and progressively changing rather than staying the same (which suggests that the technological telepathic augmentation I am hearing is the product of "real time" communication from the source of such transmissions and my brain). I think government agents (human and/or robot) are stationed at some remote location within broadcasting range of where my brain is located. There is also presumably some kind of subvocal recognition device in my brain, throat nerves, et cetera which is generating a digital signal which is being sent to the government agents such that the government agents can recognize the exact words which I am thinking in my head so that the feedback I am receiving from them is immediately relevant in a "call and response" fashion (i.e. as an actual "phone-less" phone call).
