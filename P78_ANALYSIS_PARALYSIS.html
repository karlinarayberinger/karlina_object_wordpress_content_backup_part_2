<p>After I got into a secure, comfortable, and quiet location to use my computer, my thoughts started to become more coherent than they were earlier today.</p>
<p>The &#8220;voices in my head&#8221; (which I am convinced are the result of <span style="background:#ffff00;">technological telepathy</span> beamed into my brain from some external source) gave me some suggestions for how to use this precious window of opportunity to get relevant research done. What they inspired me to do was listen to a specific noise generator app which features a looping and/or randomized sound track of people talking at the following Universal Resource Locator (URL):</p>
<p><a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/medievalVillageSoundscapeGenerator.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/medievalVillageSoundscapeGenerator.php</a></p>
<p>I turned up the volume on just the track of voices talking in the marketplace and the track of the blacksmith banging on metal.</p>
<p>(If I were hearing those kinds of sounds from their original sources and not merely through that noise generator application, I would probably be more stressed out by those sounds because of their immediacy (i.e. lack of separation between my body and the source of such sounds which the virtual simulator provides)).</p>
<p>The most interesting phenomenon I can report about listening to these sound recordings is the fact the way those sounds seem to be an anchor upon which the technologically telepathic voices seem to augment themselves onto; giving me the illusion that I am hearing personalized vocalized messages which sound as if they are part of the recorded vocalizations from the web app.</p>
<p>The kinds of personalized messages I am hearing are somewhat humorous, relevant to my specifically personal memories and recent concerns, and progressively changing rather than staying the same (which suggests that the technological telepathic augmentation I am hearing is the product of &#8220;real time&#8221; communication from the source of such transmissions and my brain).</p>
<p>Necessarily, the government agents (human and/or robot) are stationed at some remote location within broadcasting range of where my brain is located. There is also necessarily some kind of <span style="background:#ffff00;">subvocal recognition</span> device in my brain, throat/face nerves, et cetera which is generating a digital signal which is being sent to the government agents such that the government agents can recognize the exact words I am thinking so that the feedback I am receiving from the government agents is immediately relevant in a back-and-forth fashion (i.e. as an actual &#8220;phone-less&#8221; phone call).</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The significance of this journal entry is that I tend to get carried away with the wide variety of options for what my brain can lock onto in terms of attention. Once my brain detects a stimulus or thought pattern of interest, it just goes on and on down a particular trajectory (which can get quite &#8220;disorganized&#8221; and, consequently, wasteful in terms of time and neural processing power). That is probably WHY the government is communicating with me telepathically.</span></p>
<p>In summary, I think I am receiving help for my tendency to get easily distracted for both therapeutic purposes and for scientific research (which I am glad to help participate in as both a specimen and a researcher).</p>
