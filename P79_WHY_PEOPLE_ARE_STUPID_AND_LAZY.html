<p>WHY_PEOPLE_ARE_STUPID_AND_LAZY</p>
<hr>
<p>Today I had a major epiphany that will (presumably) forever dramatically change the way I utilize my time.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I realized that I am less than 1% of the way towards being what I consider to be my most ideal (yet feasible) self.</span></p>
<p>If all I did was earn enough money (whether by donations, government assistance, or income earned in exchange for performing work) to afford to live in my own apartment, pay for basic living expenses, and indulge in hobbies, I would only be about 5% of the way there. (Not too long ago, I was seemingly content to settle for that 5% completion and to just hover at that &#8220;cruising altitude&#8221; for the rest of my short little human lifespan (because 80 years is a far cry from 800 years and I want nothing less than 1,000 years to climb as high as possible (and I want to live to see the day in which I become a cyborg and not just a monkey))).</p>
<p>The remaining 95% of incomplete progress towards manifesting my ideal (yet feasible) self would mostly come from the kinds of intellectual breakthroughs I just now started realized are indeed possible for me to experience (but not by mere accident or by passive media consumption, of course).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The kinds of intellectual up-leveling I thirst for more than food itself is a desire to immerse most of my waking hours doing whatever solitary research and engineering hobbies I find worth my time to pursue. I really do not need or want friends. I feel that society demands that I have friends in order to earn even a measly paycheck (which is why my job search is currently and indefinitely &#8220;on hold&#8221;).</span></p>
<p>The ways in which I have written, spoken, thought, and generally expressed myself up until now have been EXTREMELY watered down for the depressingly immature masses. I feel so profoundly unhappy about how much of my own limited time I have wasted on trying to adapt to a society comprised of mentally blind idiots that I almost feel murderous or suicidal (but I am calm, in control, and very practiced at looking nonchalant&#8230;even to myself&#8230;until the pressure of living a lie is too immense to bare).</p>
<p>Today I am breaking away from the very slowed down and pedantic methods in which I used to do my work. The next computer program I write will not include function comments for that reason. (After all, I am not writing computer programs for young children or, not that much brighter, the average American adult).</p>
<p>So why do I suggest that people are generally stupid and lazy? I have witnessed a terrible systemic process of discouragement which essentially punishes people like me for making extraordinary efforts to improve one&#8217;s craft (and to actually make measurable progress) only to see that progress come with some kind of seemingly irrelevant and SOCIALLY IMPOSED penalty cost (not a cost that is physically necessary&#8230;but a cost that is deemed to be &#8220;morally necessary&#8221; according to some informational traffic cop (in order to <span style="background:#ffff00;">deter people from taking significant risks such that most people are lulled into living lives in which caution and comfort take precedence over unbridled (yet necessarily risky and, hence, stressful) ambition</span>).</p>
<p>For example, I finally overcame my lifelong entanglement with &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; only to discover that, when I attempted to back up my first actual professional-quality blog post, some denial of service attacker kept intercepting my attempts to back that page up to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org such that I reached the maximum daily backup quota of 10 transactions before that page could be backed up. (My fear is that will happen again tomorrow and perhaps the next day, and the next day, and the next day, et cetera such that I never get the chance to preserve my entire website in the annals of Archive dot Org before I die (or before some asshole hacks my actual website (and/or GitHub backups) and either ruins those files or else deletes some of all of them before I have the chance to back it up to the ultimate Internet Archive)). Needless to say, I am almost never in a good mood because some human-caused technical impedance to my progress always happens multiple times per day every day (and, <span style="background:#ffff00;">the more I accomplish and the harder I work, the more I seem to get attacked by PEOPLE and their intentionally limiting systems</span>).</p>
<p>Speaking of &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; (see <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/defying_the_patriarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFYING_THE_PATRIARCHY</a>), it seems that women (more so than men) are especially conditioned to play dumb almost as a requirement to get anything done because to do otherwise apparently ruffles the feathers of fragile and Very Important Egos.</p>
<p>What I hate most about humanity is the way people seem to flippantly suggest that I just not care so much about what I care about; to just slack off and not work so hard so that I can &#8220;hang out&#8221; and be more like everyone else: chummy, bummy, slummy, slackers and sloths who seem dangerously apathetic about the future (as if they seriously intend for almost no human to leave a legacy which will last at least a thousand years (and preferably for all eternity)).</p>
<p><span>I hypothesize that at least 60% of humanity&#8217;s efforts are essentially wasted on cleaning up the same psychological messes which keep getting made over and over again because the solutions people deploy are mere temporary quick fixes (i.e. unpleasant symptom suppression instead of permanent root cause logical correction).</span> Hence, I fucking retire from being every person&#8217;s damned psychologist. I will leave humans to either fix themselves or not while I forge light years ahead because I refuse to let anyone of those pig monkeys hold me back. Most human friendships are a waste of my time. This is the final time I will make that announcement. I predict that this news will be largely ignored by humans as they try to force me into stunting my consciousness expanding progress just to stay relevant and comprehensible to them (in their <span>disgustingly slow-progressing and unnecessarily high-maintenance mutual admiration cults</span>).</p>
<p>If you are hurt by anything I have said in this blog, you do not know real suffering (nor would I wish that on you unless you have the balls to go the distance I intend to).</p>
<p>No more pep talks, pinkies. Social justice is for lazy whores who only want to chew on recycled cliches and recite being offended. Goodbye!</p>
<hr>
<p>P: &#8220;Do not defy me! I am your lord and savior (and I can destroy you any time I want to).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I do not find you worthy of my admiration. I hate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Then I will cast a terrible spell on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>While writing this some hacker started sabotaging this page just to flex its power and to suggest that I cannot breathe without its permission. Perhaps this is a cue that I need to assume that I must be ANONYMOUS for now on and to let go of needing to claim credit for my own work. (That would be very spiritual of me if I were able to let go of having to be recognized by other people as the author of my own work).</p>
<p>Life is more often pain than pleasure for me (and no amount of &#8220;spiritual purification&#8221; will ever be enough to prevent likely inevitable suffering, sabotage, and fear mongering which humans use their &#8220;strength in numbers&#8221; and &#8220;higher than thou&#8221; administrative powers to wield against the comparatively small and weak). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I detest the &#8220;strength in numbers&#8221; mandate. I would rather suffer more than the average person just to keep my autonomy and to not be just another cow in a huddle who can only move in lockstep with its herd.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Just because weaponized bullies terrorize the masses into moving at the pace they are bullied into moving and thinking within the bounds of thoughts they are bullied into thinking does not mean I will pretend that I am friends with the bullies (like so many wimps do).</span></p>
<p>Well, I do not think my capacity for rage will go away. Anger and anxiety are my fuel (and of all the animalistic stress responses, I would always prefer &#8220;flight&#8221; to &#8220;fight&#8221; and to &#8220;freeze&#8221; and to &#8220;fawn&#8221; (see for  <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/anarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANARCHY</a> details)).</p>
<p>flight : flow :: fight : resistance.</p>
<p>flight : flow :: freeze : resistance.</p>
<p>flight : flow :: fawn : resistance.</p>
<p>flow : freedom :: resistance : restriction.</p>
