WHY_PEOPLE_ARE_STUPID_AND_LAZY

Today I had a major epiphany that will (presumably) forever dramatically change the way I utilize my time. 

I realized that I am less than 1% of the way towards being what I consider to be my most ideal (yet feasible) self.

If all I wanted to do was earn enough money (whether by donations, government assistance, or income earned in exchange for performing work) to afford to live in my own apartment, pay for basic living expenses, and indulge in hobbies, I would only be about 5% of the way there.

The remaining 95% of incomplete progress towards manifesting my ideal (yet feasible) self would mostly come from the kinds of intellectual breakthroughs I just now started realized are indeed possible for me to experience (but not by mere accident or by passive media consumption, of course). 

The kinds of intellectual upleveling I thirst for more than food itself is a desire to immerse most of my waking hours doing whatever solitary research and engineering hobbies I find worth my time to pursue. I really do not need or want friends. I feel that society demands that I have friends in order to earn even a measley paycheck (which is why my job search is currently and indefinitely "on hold").
