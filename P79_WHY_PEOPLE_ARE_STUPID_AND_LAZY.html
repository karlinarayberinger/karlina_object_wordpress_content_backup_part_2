WHY_PEOPLE_ARE_STUPID_AND_LAZY

Today I had a major epiphany that will (presumably) forever dramatically change the way I utilize my time. 

I realized that I am less than 1% of the way towards being what I consider to be my most ideal (yet feasible) self.

If all I wanted to do was earn enough money (whether by donations, government assistance, or income earned in exchange for performing work) to afford to live in my own apartment, pay for basic living expenses, and indulge in hobbies, I would only be about 5% of the way there.

The remaining 95% of incomplete progress towards manifesting my ideal (yet feasible) self would mostly come from the kinds of intellectual breakthroughs I just now started realized are indeed possible for me to experience (but not by mere accident or by passive media consumption, of course). 

The kinds of intellectual upleveling I thirst for more than food itself is a desire to immerse most of my waking hours doing whatever solitary research and engineering hobbies I find worth my time to pursue. I really do not need or want friends. I feel that society demands that I have friends in order to earn even a measley paycheck (which is why my job search is currently and indefinitely "on hold").

The ways in which I have written, spoken, thought, and generally expressed myself up until now have been EXTREMELEY watered down for the depressingly immature masses. I feel so profoundly unhappy about how much of my own limited time I have wasted on trying to adapt to a society comprised of mentally blind idiots that I almost feel murderous or suicidal (but I am calm, in control, and very practiced at looking nonchalant...even to myself...until the pressure of living a lie is too immense to bare). 

Today I am breaking away from the very slowed down and pendantic methods in which I used to do my work. The next computer program I write will not include function comments for that reason. (After all, I am not writing computer programs for young children or, not that much brighter, the average American adult).

So why do I suggest that people are generally stupid and lazy? I have witnessed a terrible systemic process of discouragement which essentially punishes people like me for making extraordinary efforts to improve one's craft (and to actually make measurable progress) only to see that progress come with some kind of seemingly irrelevant and SOCIALLY IMPOSED penalty cost.

For example, I finally overcame my lifelong entanglement with "the patriarchy" only to discover that, when I attempted to back up my first actual professional-quality blog post, some denial of service attacker kept intercepting my attempts to back that page up to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org such that I reached the maximum daily backup quota of 10 transactions before that page could be backed up. (My fear is that will happen again tomorrow and perhaps the next day, and the next day, and the next day, et cetera such that I never get the chance to preserve my entire website in the annals of Archive dot Org before I die (or before some asshole hacks my actual website (and/or GitHub backups) and either ruins those files or else deletes some of all of them before I have the chance to back it up to the ultimate Internet Archive)). Needless to say, I am almost never in a good mood because some human-caused technical impedence to my progress always happens multiple times per day.

What I hate most about humanity is the way people seem to flippantly suggest that I just not care so much about what I care about; to just slack off and not work so hard so that I can "hang out" and be more like everyone else: chummy, bummy, slummy, slackers and sloths who seem dangerously apathetic about the future (as if they seriously intend for almost no human to leave a legacy which will last at least a thousand years (and preferrably for all eternity)).
