WHY_PEOPLE_ARE_STUPID_AND_LAZY

Today I had a major epiphany that will (presumably) forever dramatically change the way I utilize my time. 

I realized that I am less than 1% of the way towards being what I consider to be my most ideal (yet feasible) self.

If all I wanted to do was earn enough money (whether by donations, government assistance, or income earned in exchange for performing work) to afford to live in my own apartment, pay for basic living expenses, and indulge in hobbies, I would only be about 5% of the way there.
