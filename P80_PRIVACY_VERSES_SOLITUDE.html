PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE

<hr>

Privacy is something I do not really seem to personally want nor have. 

By contrast, solitude is something I do seem to personally want and have.

<strong>Privacy</strong> is the condition of some finite container of information being metaphorically opaque rather than transparent. 

By defintion, the contents of a private container are invisible to observers which are external to that container. 

By contrast, the contents of a non-private container are visible to at least one observer which is external to that container.

(As a corollary, observers which are able to enter the private container or find some hole on that container are able to see the contents of that otherwise private container such that it is no longer private (and the contents are 100% private until some observer which is initially external to that container is able to penetrate that container and consequently see what is inside).

The next output of some random number generating function is private because (presumably) no observer knows what that output will be (unless that observer knows exactly how that randomness is derived (and the ability to predict the output of a random number generating function is a function of what can be known about the system which powers that random number generating function such that the function output is predictable within some consistent probability range)). 

The "pseudo random" number generating function is more than 99% predictable because a "pseudo random" number generating function is entirely seeded by the regular computer processor clock cycles (which is practically deterministic but not 100% guaranteed to always behave in a consistent manner due to chaos (and chaos can spawn at any point in a physical system (and only purely abstract systems are devoid of chaos (and purely abstract systems are inert and timeless)))).

By contrast, a "true random" number generating function uses something other than the "closed system" which is a digital computer as the input seed such as electrostatic radiation from Earth's atmosphere generated by the cumulative lightening storms which occur around the globe. (It is harder for an observer to identify the factors which cause the electical storms than it is for an observer to identify the factors which cause a computer processor to generate "random numbers" in succession).

<strong>Solitude</strong> is the condition of some observor organism, X, perceiving that no other organism within the same species as X are present within the same location as X.

By location, I mean to imply some kind of finite allocation of time and space which includes X as the only member of its species (according to X).

If I am the only human in a classroom, then I am in solitude. Ah! Sweet solitude!

If I use my laptop to join a video conference with at least one other human, then I could still say that I am in solitude (but not socially isolated) since the human(s) I am video conferencing with are not able to touch my body.

While I use my laptop to communicate with at least one other human via some video conference, I am free to exit the video conference at any time (which is liberating).

By contrast, if at least one other human is in the same room as I am, that other human could block the door as I try to leave such that I am forced to engage in physical combat with the human trying to trap me into staying in that human's location.
