PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE

<hr>

Privacy is something I do not really seem to personally need nor want nor have. 

By contrast, solitude is something I do seem to personally need and want and have.

What is privacy? 

What is solitude? 

What is need? 

What is want?

Privacy is the condition of some finite container of information being metaphorically opaque rather than transparent.
