PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE

<hr>

Privacy is something I do not really seem to personally need nor want nor have. 

By contrast, solitude is something I do seem to personally need and want and have.

What is privacy? 

What is solitude? 

What is need? 

What is want?

Privacy is the condition of some finite container of information being metaphorically opaque rather than transparent. 

By defintion, the contents of a private container are invisible to observers which are external to that container. 

(As a corollary, observers which are able to enter the private container or find some hole on that container are able to see the contents of that otherwise private container such that it is no longer private (and the contents are 100% private until some observer which is initially external to that container is able to penetrate that container and consequently see what is inside).
