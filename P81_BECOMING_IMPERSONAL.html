<p>I spent the last four hours listening to immersive instrumental music which ushered my mind on a soulful journey that made me feel dissolved into nature and timeless.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be sheltered from the harshness of the rain, wind, and cold in a dark and familiar place that is more home to me than any house I have ever stayed in.</p>
<p>There is a feeling of epic interplanetary wanderlust and inspiration so satisfying that words alone can hardly convey as I integrate the suppressed parts of my old identity as a 21-year-old computer science major who was bursting with enthusiasm to become engaged with Silicon Valley culture and the evolution of computers.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been hesitant to resume developing software until I feel sure that my motives are not corrupt by my egotism (or the egotism of humanity in general).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Corruption is breaking the chrysalis of a caterpillar still in the midst of morphing into a butterfly out of reckless impatience to get the final result.</span> Impatience has corrosively eaten away my compassion for humans (and for the things I love infinitely more than humans (<span style="background:#ffff00;">yes I am unabashedly and eternally a misanthrope (but not an intentionally violent nor sadistic one</span>))). Recently, I was internally boiling over with white-hot rage at the slowness of human progress to adopt my sensibilities (as arrogant or non-arrogant as that sounds). In my exasperation, I left some nasty shit deposits which have the stench of a quiet misanthrope slowly learning to accept being housed in a mortal ape&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>The Karlina of yesteryear is essentially already dead. Many (if not all) of the cells which comprise its carcass have been replaced since the year 2011. Memories from them are still somewhat reachable now (because I really did not start feeling like a real person before I reached legal adulthood (because childhood for me felt like a very long train ride as a mere passenger shrouded in claustrophobic myopia and macabre dread of some terrible events on the horizon of the future)).</p>
<p>It was not until 2009 that I was able to feel a genuine sense of joyful anticipation about the future thanks to what I learned in college and from my best friend, SD. I spent a lot of time reading books and going on leisurely hikes (and racking up an embarrassing amount of debt) to live lavishly before I got my first real job as a Google Apps Script developer at Lawrence Berkeley Lab in 2012. When that internship ended in September 2015, so did my sense of continuity towards that much awaited Silicon Valley future.</p>
<p>I since then plummeted into the grimy trenches of minimum wage retail jobs and lost my desire to make friends with other humans when I lost my best friend SD (and the closest friend I have had since, AP, just did not connect with me on the same soulful level as SD and I did (which made the past six years disorienting and deceptively isolating&#8230;as I had no real friend other than my own consciousness)).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">At this point, I have no human friends. I have species dysphoria. That is fine with me.</span> I find humans to be ugly in their addiction to violence, callousness, complacency, cultural conformity, vanity, myopia, greed, and lack of intellectual sophistication such that I want nothing more than to be a modern sage who immerses itself in making art, studying whatever subjects seem worth my time to study, and to let my intuition about nature take me closer to letting my mortal identities be mere shells while I pursue a much deeper and more timeless love affair with consciousness itself; the bedrock of nature.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, consciousness is the container of all physical phenomena rather than the reverse. In other words, I think nature is fundamentally &#8220;mind stuff&#8221; (and so are all of the particles, dark matter, et cetera which comprise nature).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"> I want to devote a significant portion the rest of my life to leisurely studying math and logic because such systems are &#8220;solid state&#8221; and untouchably eternal structures of infinite complexity and beauty.</span></p>
<p>I intend for this blog post to represent the boundary between my &#8220;crazed asshole&#8221; stage and the increasingly impersonal stage afterwards. For now on, I intend to refrain from polluting this blog with ad hominem content (i.e. stuff which pertains to criticizing specific human individuals or specific human groups). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I will not let this blog continue to be a waste dump for toxic human sentiments and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; (since I have already done that for the sake of promoting freedom of speech).</span></p>
