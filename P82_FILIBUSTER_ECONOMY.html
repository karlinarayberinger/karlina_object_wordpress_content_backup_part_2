FILIBUSTER_ECONOMY

<Hypothesis: at least 70% of all paid human labor is incentivizing human employees to <span style='background:#ffff00;">enable monopolistic corporations to procrastinate on transitioning as quickly as possible from reliance on fossil fuels to reliance on non-polluting alternative energy sources</span> (so that the highest-paid members of such organizations can extract as much profit for as little cost as possible (since transitioning to sustainable infrastructure is a costly investment (at least initially) for leaders of such organizations)).

Note_0: a <strong>Ponzi Scheme</strong> (also known as a <strong>multi-level marketing scheme</strong>) is a pyramid-shaped hierarchal organization which generates the most income from the lowest tiers of the organization by paying those low-tier employees as little as possible and transferring as much of that income (which would otherwise be paid out to the lowest-tier members) to the upper levels of the organization such that a disproportionately small number of organization members are paid disproportionately higher than the lower-tiered members. To keep low-tier members from discovering too much information about this imbalance of wealth distribution within the organization, the turnover rate for hiring new and naive organization members as lowest-tier members is high so that the organization leadership is mostly kept a secret from the lowest-tier members and from the general public.

Note_1: a <strong>filibuster</strong> is an activity which does little more than stall progress towards completing some task. For example, the astronomically energy-costly work which goes into solving the mathematical puzzles which cryptocurrency miners solve in order to be rewarded with cryptocurrency is a filibuster expense (because such work does nothing other than prove that a miner is willing and able to invest a significant amount of labor in mining cryptocurrency for the sake of establishing credibility as a miner (which is an appeal to <strong>ethos</strong> rather than to <strong>logos</strong>)).
