<p>FILIBUSTER_ECONOMY</p>

<p>Hypothesis: at least 70% of all paid human labor is incentivizing human employees to <span style="background:#ffff00;">enable monopolistic corporations to procrastinate on transitioning as quickly as possible from reliance on fossil fuels to reliance on non-polluting alternative energy sources</span> (so that the highest-paid members of such organizations can extract as much profit for as little cost as possible (since transitioning to sustainable infrastructure is a costly investment (at least initially) for leaders of such organizations)).</p>

<p>Note_0: a <strong>Ponzi Scheme</strong> (also known as a <strong>multi-level marketing scheme</strong>) is a pyramid-shaped hierarchical organization which generates the most income from the lowest tiers of the organization by paying those low-tier employees as little as possible and transferring as much of that income (which would otherwise be paid out to the lowest-tier members) to the upper levels of the organization such that a disproportionately small number of organization members are paid disproportionately higher than the lower-tiered members. <span style="background:#ffff00;">To keep low-tier members from discovering too much information about this imbalance of wealth distribution within the organization, the turnover rate for hiring new and naive organization members as lowest-tier members is high so that the organization leadership is mostly kept a secret from the lowest-tier members and from the general public.</span></p>
<p>(Turnover rate is the frequency at which some organization fires employees (or discourages those employees from staying employed at the organization by making the working conditions as painful as possible) and replaces them with new hires).</p>

<p>Note_1: a <strong>filibuster</strong> is an activity which does little more than stall progress towards completing some task. For example, <span style="background:#ffff00;">the astronomically large energy costs which power the computers for solving the complex mathematical puzzles which cryptocurrency miners solve in order to be rewarded with cryptocurrency is a filibuster expense</span> (because such work does nothing other than prove that a miner is willing and able to invest a significant amount of labor in mining cryptocurrency for the sake of establishing credibility as a cryptocurrency miner (which is an appeal to <strong>ethos</strong> rather than to <strong>logos</strong>)).</p>
