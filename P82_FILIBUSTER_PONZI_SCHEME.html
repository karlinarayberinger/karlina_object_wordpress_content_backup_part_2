Hypothesis: at least 70% of all paid human labor is incentivizing human employees to enable monopolistic corporations to procrastinate on transitioning as quickly as possible from reliance on fossil fuels to reliance on non-polluting alternative energy sources (so that the highest-paid members of such organizations can extract as much profit for as little cost as possible (since transitioning to sustainable infrastructure is a costly investment (at least initially) for leaders of such organizations)). 

Note: a Ponzi Scheme (also known as a multi-level marketing scheme) is a pyramid-shaped hierarchal organization which generates the most income from the lowest tiers of the organization by paying those low-tier employees as little as possible and transferring as much of that income (which would otherwise be paid out to the lowest-tier members) to the upper levels of the organization such that a disproportionately small number of organization members are paid disproportionately higher than the lower-tiered members. To keep low-tier members from discovering too much information about this imbalance of wealth distribution within the organization, the turnover rate for hiring new and naive organization members as lowest-tier members is high so that the organization leadership is mostly kept a secret from the lowest-tier members and from the general public.
