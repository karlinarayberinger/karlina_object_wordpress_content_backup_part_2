<p>BEST_THREE_PAGES_THUS_FAR_VERSION_TWO</p>
<hr>
<p>As of today, what I consider to be the best three pages of this website are pinned at the top of my Minds dot Com content list (username: <a href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_0: <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/pi_approximation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PI_APPROXIMATION</a>.</p>
<p>This is my favorite JavaScript web page application thus far because it demonstrates how to implement timed animations, geometry, and it shows how integer ratios can be used to approximate quantities which are impossible to represent as a finite sequence of digits (and that approximation generally becomes more accurate the larger the integer input set becomes).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_1: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/analysis_paralysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS</a>.</p>
<p>This page marks the point in my blogging journey in which I start taking my work as a brain-to-computer interface researcher seriously. For approximately two years, I have been in two-way technological telepathic communication with anonymous (presumably government) agents and, although I have attempted to describe this phenomenon in writing several times before I wrote ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS, I was unable to be as articulate as I wanted to be because I had not done enough research on the subject. In addition to describing a technology I am fortunate to be equipped with, ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS does a decent job explaining the functionality of such a technology (particularly in helping to minimize my tendency to get distracted by unproductive thoughts and sensory stimuli and by getting telepathic downloads of information I could not otherwise generate in a timely manner on my own). The page also refers to a sound generating software library which is useful for those who suffer misophonia, attention deficit, and for people who generally appreciate playing with sound (i.e. audiophiles).</p>

<p>BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_2: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/privacy_verses_solitude/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE</a>.</p>
<p>By including this page in the triad of pinned pages, I complete a logical circle which connects my interest in pure mathematics and computer science with brain-to-computer interface technology and the means to do work as a researcher and developer both &#8220;on site&#8221; and &#8220;remotely&#8221;. In PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE, I allude to the fact that randomness is subjective feature of physical systems (i.e. electronic circuits) rather than purely abstract systems (i.e. mathematical functions). Most importantly, I loosely establish the idea that my brain is a computer and my awareness is not always encompassing of all information occurring within that &#8220;black box&#8221; of a computer (thereby making my brain somewhat private with respect to my scope of awareness). Finally, the page includes a surrealist drawing of my old bedroom and a modicum of slapstick humor.</p>
