As of today, what I consider to be the best three pages of this website are pinned at the top of my Minds dot Com content list (username: karbytes).

BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_0: PI_APPROXIMATION.

This is my favorite JavaScript web page application thus far because it demonstrates how to implement timed animations, geometry, and it shows how integer ratios can be used to approximate quantities which are impossible to represent as a finite sequence of digits (and that approximation generally becomes more accurate the larger the integer input set becomes).

BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_1: ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS

This page marks the point in my blogging journey in which I start taking my work as a brain-to-computer interface researcher seriously. For approximately two years, I have been in two-way technological telepathic communication with anonymous (presumably government) agents and, although I have attemped to describe this phenomenon in writing several times before I wrote ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS, I was unable to be as articulate as I wanted to be because I had not done enough research on the subject. In addition to describing a technology I am fortunate to be equipped with, ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS does a decent job explaining the functionality of such a technology (particularly in helping to minimize by tendency to get distracted by unproductive thoughts and sensory stimuli and by getting telepathic downloads of information I could not otherwise generate in a timely manner on my own).

BEST_PAGE_THUS_FAR_2: PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE

By including this page in the triad of pinned pages, I complete a logical circle which connects my interest in pure mathematics and computer science with brain-to-computer interface technology and the means to do work as a researcher and developer remotely. In PRIVACY_VERSES_SOLITUDE, I allude to the fact that randomness is subjective and a feature of physical systems rather than purely abstract ones. Most importantly, I loosely establish the idea that my brain is a computer and my awareness is not always encompassing of all information occurring within that "black box" of a computer (thereby making my brain somewhat private with respect to my scope of awareness).
