<p>Earlier today, I sent the following (templated) email message to the administrators of Archive dot Org:</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Recipients: info@archive.org</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Sender: starduststructures@protonmail.com</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Subject: Backing Up Web Page Image (2)</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Body:</span>

<p style="color:#0000ff">I am the owner the website which contains the web page I am trying to back up to the WayBack Machine completely, yet each time I have attempted to back it up, the image on that page is not being backed up (but all the other content is). I am the owner of that image and original photographer of that image. Is there some kind of intentional restriction on backing up that particular image?</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">URL of web page: https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/radical_acceptance/</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>On my Minds dot Com account, I published a screenshot of the email message I sent with the following commentary:</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">This is just business as usual for me. It is not uncommon for pages or images on those pages which have been archived by the WayBack Machine get removed (either by robots or by humans). I think that humans remove content to test my resolve to routinely inspect the archives of my personal website so that I do not fall complacent. My website is designed to be a bit "edgy" rather than comparatively "vanilla" (and almost apologetic for existing) if it attempted to adhere only to "politically correct" and "professional" content. I am for freedom of speech and minimal censorship.</p>
