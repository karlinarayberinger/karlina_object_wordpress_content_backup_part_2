<p>Earlier today, I sent the following (templated) email message to the administrators of Archive dot Org:</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Recipients: info@archive.org</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Sender: starduststructures@protonmail.com</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Subject: Backing Up Web Page Image (2)</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Body:</span>

<p style="color:#0000ff">I am the owner the website which contains the web page I am trying to back up to the WayBack Machine completely, yet each time I have attempted to back it up, the image on that page is not being backed up (but all the other content is). I am the owner of that image and original photographer of that image. Is there some kind of intentional restriction on backing up that particular image?</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">URL of web page: https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/radical_acceptance/</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>On my Minds dot Com account, I published a screenshot of the email message I sent with the following commentary:</p>

<p style="color:#0000ff">This is just business as usual for me. It is not uncommon for pages or images on those pages which have been archived by the WayBack Machine get removed (either by robots or by humans). I think that humans remove content to test my resolve to routinely inspect the archives of my personal website so that I do not fall complacent. My website is designed to be a bit "edgy" rather than comparatively "vanilla" (and almost apologetic for existing) if it attempted to adhere only to "politically correct" and "professional" content. I am for freedom of speech and minimal censorship.</p>

<p>The significance of what I have shared in this blog post is that it shows that my personal website (Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) is quite a hefty and eclectic database all on its own. It is probably too hefty and too eclectic to be useful as a professional software developer's website. For that reason, I plan on populating this website (Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) with as many software engineering samples and eclectic posts as I desire until I have at least twenty solid programming and technical writing posts to copy paste into a new and much smaller website.</p>

<p>The new and much smaller website will be devoid of any content other than strictly what pertains to computer science. It will be quite purest, timeless, and apolitical (as I intended Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to be when I intially launched it).</p>

<p>Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com is not the most pristine, orderly, and pleasant santuary in cyberspace, but it does give my human side room to express itself and to learn from its mistakes. I do not intend for my smaller portfolio website to include any personal diaries. I do intend to keep both websites visible to the public indefinitely, but I do not expect the professional portolio site to update very often (if ever). I intend for the larger website to keep growing with every milestone I happen upon.</p>
