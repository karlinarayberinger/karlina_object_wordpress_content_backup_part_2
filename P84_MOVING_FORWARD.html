Subject: Backing Up Web Page Image (2)

Body:

I am the owner the website which contains the web page I am trying to back up to the WayBack Machine completely, yet each time I have attempted to back it up, the image on that page is not being backed up (but all the other content is). I am the owner of that image and original photographer of that image. Is there some kind of intentional restriction on backing up that particular image?

Thanks for your time.
