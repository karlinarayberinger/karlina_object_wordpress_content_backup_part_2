Many times, information traffic cops have been preventing me from making updates to anything but GitHub. For that reason, I strongly recommend that Karlina use only GitHub to publish rough drafts (whether "at home" or elsewhere). Otherwise, such notes might not ever get published. 

I see that the local economy is heavily promoting of animal products consumption. Likewise, it is virtually impossible to be a vegan at Santa Rita Jail because the food options are extremely limited.

I recommend that every citizen who is NOT in jail, pregnant, or breastfeeding an infant try the seven day vegan challenge. That would probably dramatically improve the ecosystem. Do not let poverty and a lack of sufficient free time to enjoy yourself be an excuse to not make such a modest commitment.
