Many times, information traffic cops have been preventing me from making updates to anything but GitHub. For that reason, I strongly recommend that Karlina use only GitHub (and not some other cloud-based data storage platform) to publish rough drafts of WordPress pages and Minds posts (whether those drafts are composed "at home" or elsewhere). Otherwise, such notes might not ever get published. (I would only recommend using pen and paper to spontaneously and "remotely" record rough drafts if connecting to GitHub via mobile phone Internet fails (and the mobile Internet service provider I am using to draft this note is AT&T (which I pay ~$40/month for)). That way, you reduce the risk of getting your note intercepted or lost on its way to being publicly visible online in case you are unable to get home as soon as you want to). 

I see that the local economy is heavily promoting of animal products consumption (because they are <span style="background:#ffff00;">addictive, popular, and heavily advertised</span>). Likewise, it is virtually impossible to be a vegan at Santa Rita Jail because the food options are extremely limited such that vegan options do not appear to exist.

I recommend that every citizen who is NOT in jail, pregnant, or breastfeeding an infant try the <span style="background:#ffff00;">seven day vegan challenge</span>. That would probably dramatically improve the ecosystem (if enough people made it a personal priority). Do not let poverty and a lack of sufficient free time to enjoy yourself be an excuse to not make such a modest commitment.

At the time of this writing I am using a reusable menstrual cup instead of tampons to collect the blood, discarded uterine lining, and vaginal discharge which flows out of my vagina approximately once per month (as a result of the fact that I did not get pregnant during this month's window of fertility). Not using disposable menstrual products such as tampons and panty liners helps to save money and landfill space.

Also, I do not use hormonal birth control to prevent the fertilization of my egg cells if and when sperm enter my vagina. Instead of using hormonal birth control methods (which trick the body into thinking that it is pregnant so that it does not drop any more eggs into the uterus to be fertilized) or just assuming sperm will not be entering my vagina during my windows of fertility, I am using a non-hormonal copper-releasing T-shaped device (an intrauterine device (i.e. a IUD)) which a gynecologist inserted quite painlessly into my body in 2015 to prevent the incubation of any zygotes (i.e. fertilized eggs) due to the fact the IUD releases enough copper molecules to create an inhospitable environment for zygotes to make themselves home in my uterus. An intrauterine device can remain implanted for about a decade without having to swap it with a new one (and immediately upon removing the device my fertility is back to normal such that I can immediately get pregnant). Of course, I intend to never get pregnant; but after a few years of voluntary celibacy, I do hope to partake in casual sex and group orgies.

At the time of this writing, I am mostly living outside with nothing but a backpack to store my gear. My home base is California State University East Bay in the Hayward hills. 

At my legal residence in Castro Valley, I have an extra backpack, extra sleeping bag, extra pair of Teva sandals, steel-toed work boots, a copy of my birth certificate, an unused tent, and a hideously large collection of glass dildos which I ordered online on credit back when I did little more than masturbate in mybedfroom and look at pornography on the Internet. I will go back there to collect any items I need for W-2 form (i.e. taxable income yielding) employment such as full-time warehouse work if things do not work out for me as an aspiring software engineer.

Right now, I am doing my best to mooch as little as possible from everyone (which is a fun game in itself).

I will probably need to go back to Daddae's house at least once a week to shower and wash my clothes because trying to bathe in the public bathroom sink and sun dry my clothes has been very inefficient.
