Many times, information traffic cops have been preventing me from making updates to anything but GitHub. For that reason, I strongly recommend that Karlina use only GitHub (and not some other cloud-based data storage platform) to publish rough drafts of WordPress pages and Minds posts (whether those drafts are composed "at home" or elsewhere). Otherwise, such notes might not ever get published. (I would only recommend using pen and paper to spontaneously and "remotely" record rough drafts if connecting to GitHub via mobile phone Internet fails (and the mobile Internet service provider I am using to draft this note is AT&T (which I pay ~$40/month for)). That way, you reduce the risk of getting your note intercepted or lost on its way to being publicly visible online in case you are unable to get home as soon as you want to). 

I see that the local economy is heavily promoting of animal products consumption. Likewise, it is virtually impossible to be a vegan at Santa Rita Jail because the food options are extremely limited.

I recommend that every citizen who is NOT in jail, pregnant, or breastfeeding an infant try the seven day vegan challenge. That would probably dramatically improve the ecosystem (if enough people made it a personal priority). Do not let poverty and a lack of sufficient free time to enjoy yourself be an excuse to not make such a modest commitment.
