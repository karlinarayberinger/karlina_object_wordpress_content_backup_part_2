<strong>PART_0: INTRODUCTION</strong>

The following article describes a naturalistic ideology which a person can voluntarily adopt in order to generate a sense of unconditional satisfaction.

<strong>PART_1: CONTEXT</strong>

If you are receiving the words which comprise this article, then you presumably have no choice but to acknowledge that these words exist.

Unless you are being force fed these words "against your will" in some kind of brainwashing situation, then you presumably can stop reading or listening to these words whenever you want to (but you cannot undo the fact that your consciousness happened upon these words at least once (and, hence, your mind is forever altered by such an encounter)).

It is presumed that you refers to the allocation of consciousness which is currently receiving these words right now.

It is also presumed that you refers to an allocation of consciousness which is apparently bound within the confines of exactly one linearly-progressing space-time continuum which is associated with exactly one infomration processing machine (i.e. a finite bundle of matter and energy which is apparently a subset of whatever space-time continuum that machine appears to be inhabiting (and that space-time continuum can (a) have a start point or else no start point, (b) an end point or else no end point, or (c) neither a start point nor an end point)).

<strong>PART_2: AXIOMS</strong>

All space-time continuums (whether any of those space-time continuums have zero, one, or two end points) exist within exactly one boundless and featureless substrate composed of pure consciousness.

Each individual space-time continuum is a sequence of one, multiple, or infinite "you" instances such that each "you" instance is a non-overlapping allocation of consciousness which is instantiated for at least one life span such that each life span has a start point and an end point (and each "you" instance is an element of a sequence of non-overlapping "you" instances which may either be arranged in a continuous linear sequence or else arranged in a non-linear "random" sequence).

If you were reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then you are now a descendent of the previous "you" instance (i.e. your existence right now is a function of what the previous "you" instance experienced in its own life span (which is separate from your life span yet causally connected)).

If you were not reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then you were spontaneosly generated out of pure consciousness with no "karmic scaffolding".

"Karmic scaffolding" (i.e. the preservation and evolution of some unique bundle of features from one life span to the next) is the cumulative summation of features which are passed from one "you" instance to the next "you" instance in a sequential fashion such that a previous "you" instance has less cumulative features than the current "you" instance does.

If you were reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then there is presumably some distinct set of features which were copied from the previous "you" instance such that the current "you" instance (i.e. you receiving these words) appears to have an ego which has survived for at least two consecutive life spans. 

If you are (a) reincarnated, (b) preincarnated, or (c) parallel-incarnated, the features which you inherited from some (a) previous "you" instance, (b) future "you" instance, or (c) concurrent "you" instance are copied from a "you" instance which is not the same as the current "you" instance (and not necessarily the most chronologically recent preceding "you" instance) such that your ego is the product of "random" feature selection from an array of multiple "you" instances whose chain of "karmic scaffolding" does not increment in an incremental and chronologically linear fashion across the array which contains all "you" instances.

Each multi-life-span ego is instaniated within exactly one unique array of "you" instances such that the array does not intersect with any other such array. For example, if PERSON_A is an ego which spans multiple life-spans and if PERSON_B is an ego which spans multiple life-spans, then PERSON_A and PERSON_B represent non-overlapping parallel arrays which each contain multiple "you" instances (and "you" is not the same thing as the consciousness which is receiving these words right now because "you" is a generic term for an elementary partition of some ego's continuity). Even though PERSON_A and PERSON_B are discrete allocations of consciousness, PERSON_A and PERSON_B are each contained within exactly one encompassing substrate called Nature.

The terms "previous" and "future" use you as a temporal frame of referene such that you inhabit the "now" and not the "previous" or "future" space-time allocations.

<strong>PART_3: IMMORTALITY</strong>

The fact that you (i.e. one of many possible "you" instances) are receiving these words is proof that some allocation of consciousness exists.

The fact that some allocation of consciousness exists and can observe phenomena is proof that Nature is not purely nothing.

The fact that Nature is not purely nothing implies that Nature can never be purely nothing (since your existence makes that impossible since you are not nothing).

What you are is something which seemingly emerges from nothing (and which seemingly dissolves into nothing).

If you live once, you can presumably live more than once through reincarnation.

Even if you live for only one life-span, the substrate which contains and which comprises you never stops existing (and whose existence has no beginning).

As long as you identify with the substrate which never stops existing (and whose existence has no beginning), then you are as immortal as Nature because you are Nature.

If you identify as Nature, then you implicitly include every ego as part of your own ego in whatever you call your life-span (and the ego which you define to be you within your life-span is more than just the set of all egos throughout all existence; it also includes the empty set (i.e. pure nothingness) as part of itself).

If you identify as Nature, then your most fundamental essence is indestructible and limitless in its ability to generate novelty. You will never be eternally bored because you do more than exist as purely nothing (and you contain all the numbers (which are infinite)).
