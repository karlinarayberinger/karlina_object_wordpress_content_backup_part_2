The following article describes a naturalistic ideology which a person can voluntarily adopt in order to generate a sense of unconditional satisfaction.

<strong>PART_1: CONTEXT</strong>

If you are receiving the words which comprise this article, then you presumably have no choice but to acknowledge that these words exist.

Unless you are being force fed these words "against your will" in some kind of brainwashing situation, then you presumably can stop reading or listening to these words whenever you want to (but you cannot undo the fact that your consciousness happened upon these words at least once (and, hence, your mind is forever altered by such an encounter)).

It is presumed that "you" refers to the allocation of consciousness which is currently receiving these words right now.

It is also presumed that "you" refers to an allocation of consciousness which is apparently bound within the confines of exactly one linearly-progressing space-time continuum which is associated with exactly one infomration processing machine (i.e. a finite bundle of matter and energy which is apparently a subset of whatever space-time continuum that machine appears to be inhabiting (and that space-time continuum can (a) have a start point or else no start point, (b) an end point or else no end point, or (c) neither a start point nor an end point)).
