<strong>PART_0: INTRODUCTION</strong>

The following article describes a naturalistic ideology which a person can voluntarily adopt in order to generate a sense of unconditional satisfaction.

<strong>PART_1: CONTEXT</strong>

If you are receiving the words which comprise this article, then you presumably have no choice but to acknowledge that these words exist.

Unless you are being force fed these words "against your will" in some kind of brainwashing situation, then you presumably can stop reading or listening to these words whenever you want to (but you cannot undo the fact that your consciousness happened upon these words at least once (and, hence, your mind is forever altered by such an encounter)).

It is presumed that "you" refers to the allocation of consciousness which is currently receiving these words right now.

It is also presumed that "you" refers to an allocation of consciousness which is apparently bound within the confines of exactly one linearly-progressing space-time continuum which is associated with exactly one infomration processing machine (i.e. a finite bundle of matter and energy which is apparently a subset of whatever space-time continuum that machine appears to be inhabiting (and that space-time continuum can (a) have a start point or else no start point, (b) an end point or else no end point, or (c) neither a start point nor an end point)).

<strong>PART_2: AXIOMS</strong>

All space-time continuums (whether any of those space-time continuums have zero, one, or two end points) exist within exactly one boundless and featureless substrate composed of pure consciousness.

Each individual space-time continuum is a sequence of one, multiple, or infinite "you" instances such that each "you" instance is a non-overlapping allocation of consciousness which is instantiated for at least one life span such that each life span has a start point and an end point (and each "you" instance is an element of a sequence of non-overlapping "you" instances which may either be arranged in a continuous linear sequence or else arranged in a non-linear "random" sequence).

If "you" were reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then "you" are now a descendent of the previous "you" instance (i.e. your existence right now is a function of what the previous "you" instance experienced in its own life span (which is separate from your life span yet causally connected)).

If "you" were not reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then "you" were spontaneosly generated out of pure consciousness with no "karmic scaffolding".

"Karmic scaffolding" (i.e. the preservation and evolution of some unique bundle of features from one life span to the next) is the cumulative summation of features which are passed from one "you" instance to the next "you" instance in a sequential fashion such that a previous "you" instance has less cumulative features than the current "you" instance does.

If "you" were reincarnated from a previous "you" instance, then there is presumably some distinct set of features which were copied from the previous "you" instance such that "you" appear to have an ego which has survived for at least two consecutive life spans.
