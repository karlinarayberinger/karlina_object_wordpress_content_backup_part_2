CONSCIENTIOUS_OMNIVORE

<hr>

What came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg came first because it is a single-called organism (i.e. prokaryote) instead of a more evolutionarily complex multi-cellular organism (i.e. eukaryote). The egg is therefore assumed to have less sentience bound up in its form than a chicken is. Therefore, eating the egg is the "lesser of the two evils" (if consuming animal products is a sin (and vegans, by definition, classify all animal products as sinful to purchase, consume, and promote)).

What about eggs which were laid by chickens who were not locked up in cages? What about milk which was pumped from goats who were not locked up in cages? <span style="#ffff00;">What about synthetic stem-cell derived animal products? What about plant-based replicas of animal products?</span> What about means of farming which do not require clearing out rain forests and releasing tons of carbon, methane, carcinogenic molecules, and other ecologically-destabilizing and health-hazardous waste into the atmosphere, waters, and soils?

As much as I have tried to minimize my investment in the suffering of animals, there comes a point in which my own welfare as an animal takes precedence over my prey. I now grant myself permission to be a conscious (and, therefore, conscientious) omnivore; one who strives to minimize investing in and subsisting on products and industries which harm sentient creatures. I will do my best to maximize the vegan to non-vegan ratio of my diet to minimize my negative ecological impact (since the meat industry tends to be quite ecologically taxing compared to the plant-based foods industry).
