<p>What came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg came first because it is a single-called organism (i.e. prokaryote) instead of a more evolutionarily complex multi-cellular organism (i.e. eukaryote). <span style="background:#ffff00;">The egg is assumed to have less sentience bound up in its form than a chicken is. Therefore, eating the egg is the &#8220;lesser of the two evils&#8221;</span> (if consuming animal products is a sin (and vegans, by definition, classify all animal products as sinful to purchase, consume, and promote)).</p>
<p>What about eggs which were laid by chickens who were not locked up in cages? What about milk which was pumped from goats and cattle who were not forcibly raped (by humans with insemination sticks) to keep lactating? <span style="background:#ffff00;">What about synthetic stem-cell derived animal products? What about plant-based replicas of animal products?</span> What about means of farming which do not require clearing out rain forests and releasing tons of carbon, methane, carcinogenic molecules, and other ecologically-destabilizing and health-hazardous waste into the atmosphere, waters, and soils? Must so-called healthy food be manufactured in ways which depend on slave labor, warfare, and the torturing of sentient creatures?</p>
<p>Why would health be worth such a hefty cost to the system which sustains the so-called health-conscious end user if that system ultimately destroys every point of the system (end user included)? As long as I think I have a window of opportunity to enjoy my hamburger before the ecological apocalypse happens (which is spurred on by the hamburger industry), I will just say that my ecological impact is negligible and eat my hamburger with pride and contentment while ignoring any news which makes me feel uncomfortable about my choices as a consumer. (I am being facetious. This is what playing devil&#8217;s advocate looks like).</p>
<p>As much as I have tried to minimize my investment in the suffering of animals, there comes a point in which my own welfare as an animal takes precedence over my prey (because, if I were left to fend for myself in the wilderness, I would voluntarily default to being a predator rather than default to being someone else&#8217;s prey if my bodily survival required that I hunt and kill simpler animals for nourishment and inflict bodily harm upon predators of any species who threaten my bodily survival). I now grant myself permission to be a conscious (and, therefore, conscientious) omnivore; one who strives to minimize investing in and subsisting on products and industries which harm sentient creatures. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I will do my best to maximize the vegan to non-vegan ratio of my diet to minimize my negative ecological impact</span> (since the meat industry tends to be quite ecologically taxing compared to the plant-based foods industry).</p>
