INTRINSIC_VALUE

<hr>

PERSON_Z: "Suppose that somebody (i.e. a humanoid named PERSON_X) other than yourself (and you are a humanoid named PERSON_Y) has been intercepting each of your brain's original thoughts in succession before your allotment of awareness has time to consciously register such thoughts and, as soon as PERSON_X receives a copy of each of your thoughts, PERSON_X immediately and automatically transcribes each of those thought copies in succession and verbatim into a digital format which appears as publicly visible text (and visual images, sounds, and other multi-sensory media formats) on a public website which PERSON_X claims as its own original intellectual property (and PERSON_X licenses such intellectual property as proprietary material which is illegal for any person other than PERSON_X to publish copies of and to claim as one's own original work). Would you still keep publishing your own thoughts on your own public website?"

PERSON_Y: "Yes. Of course I would keep publishing my own ideas on my own blog. Why would I not?"

PERSON_Z: "According to some large committee of humanoids (i.e. GROUP_A) who democratically vote on which humanoid activities are legally permissible and which humanoid activities are not legally permissible, your blog is considered to be a waste of community resources (i.e. communications infrastructure and cognitive bandwidth) because your job as a philosophy blogger has been deemed to be legally outsourced to the rich, famous, and esteemed philosophy blogger named PERSON_X (since the legal system, as defined by GROUP_A) treats an original work of art as belonging to the first person to publish that work of art under a proprietary (i.e. not open-source) license rather than the first person to generate such thoughts."

PERSON_Y: "Even if publishing my own original thoughts on my own public blog were deemed by GROUP_A to be illegal, I would still do it anyway because I derive intrinsic value in the form of self-esteem from the activity of writing, publishing, and reading my own original work on my own public blog (even if PERSON_X's blog gets significantly more page views, praise, and monetary donations from the general public than my blog does)."
