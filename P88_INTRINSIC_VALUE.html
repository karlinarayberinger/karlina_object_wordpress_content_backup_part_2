INTRINSIC_VALUE

<hr>

PERSON_Z: "Suppose that somebody (i.e. a humanoid named PERSON_X) other than yourself (and you are a humanoid named PERSON_Y) has been intercepting each of your brain's original thoughts in succession before your allotment of awareness has time to consciously register such thoughts and, as soon as PERSON_X receives a copy of each of your thoughts, PERSON_X immediately and automatically transcribes each of those thought copies in succession and verbatim into a digital format which appears as publicly visible text (and visual images, sounds, and other multi-sensory media formats) on a public website which PERSON_X claims as its own original intellectual property (and PERSON_X licenses such intellectual property as proprietary material which is illegal for any person other than PERSON_X to publish copies of and to claim as one's own original work). Would you still keep publishing your own thoughts on your own public website?"

PERSON_Y: "Yes. Of course I would keep publishing my own ideas on my own blog. Why would I not?"

PERSON_Z: "According to some large committee of humanoids (i.e. GROUP_A) who democratically vote on which humanoid activities are legally permissible and which humanoid activities are not legally permissible, your blog is considered to be a waste of community resources (i.e. communications infrastructure and cognitive bandwidth) because your job as a philosophy blogger has been deemed to be legally outsourced to the rich, famous, and esteemed philosophy blogger named PERSON_X (since the legal system, as defined by GROUP_A) treats an original work of art as belonging to the first person to publish that work of art under a proprietary (i.e. not open-source) license rather than the first person to generate such thoughts."

PERSON_Y: "Even if publishing my own original thoughts on my own public blog were deemed by GROUP_A to be illegal, I would still do it anyway because I derive intrinsic value in the form of self-esteem from the activity of writing, publishing, and reading my own original work on my own public blog (even if PERSON_X's blog gets significantly more page views, praise, and monetary donations from the general public than my blog does)."

PERSON_Z: "Suppose your blog got removed from the Internet by GROUP_A's information technology task force due to copyright infringement. What would you do then?"

PERSON_Y: "I would still keep trying to launch one website after another in order to share my ideas with the world."

PERSON_Z: "Suppose GROUP_A's information technology task force banned you from using the Internet and locked you up in maximum security prison for the rest of your life under the criminal charge that you are indeed a repeat offender of legal copyright infringement?"

PERSON_X: "As disappointing as that would be for me, I would do my best to make the most of my prison sentence by using it as an opportunity to become a well-practiced monk who spends most of its time meditating and doing yoga."

PERSON_Z: "Suppose that GROUP_A's criminal justice league sentenced you to being physically restrained by brain-to-computer interfacing devices which turn off your non-vital motor functions such that you are forced to live as a fully paralyzed yet fully conscious prisoner whose thoughts are mined, filtered, and sold in parts to whoever the highest bidder is."

PERSON_X: "As bleak and as limiting as my life would be at that point, I would nevertheless commit myself to the humbling task of serving up the highest-quality insights I can to those who want them."

PERSON_Z: "Good job. You passed the moral integrity test according to GROUP_A."
