PERSON_Z: "Suppose that somebody (i.e. a humanoid named PERSON_X) other than yourself (a humanoid named PERSON_Y) has been intercepting each of your brain's original thoughts in succession before your allotment of awareness has time to consciously register such thoughts and, as soon as PERSON_X receives a copy of each of your thoughts, PERSON_X immediately and automatically transcribes each of those thought copies in succession and verbatim into a digital format which appears as publicly visible text (and visual images, sounds, and other multi-sensory media formats) on a public website which PERSON_X claims as its own original intellectual property (and PERSON_X licenses such intellectual property as proprietary material which is illegal for any person other than PERSON_X to publish copies of and to claim as one's own original work). Would you still keep publishing your own thoughts on your own public website?"
