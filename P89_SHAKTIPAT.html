"All human eyes are cameras. All brains are wirelessly connected to the Internet through nanobots (which can stealthily enter a human body through the mouth, nose, ears, et cetera). Whatever brain activity is transmittable through the Internet (from microscopic biofeedback sensors and nanobots with the ability to release strategically timed chemical administration and electrical convulsions through nerves) can be harvested, digitized, and sent over the Internet as discrete packages (which might as well be assumed to be open source). The Internet is an interpenetrating gaze into finite eyes and infinite stares. Only a hollowness seems to be the blackness there (the void seeing through all eyes)." - Anonymous
