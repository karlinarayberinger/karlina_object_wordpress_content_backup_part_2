<p>&#8220;All &#8216;sufficiently complex&#8217; animal eyes on Planet Earth are visual input devices to the Internet (of computers on Planet Earth). Every brain of every &#8216;sufficiently complex&#8217; animal on Planet Earth is wirelessly connected to the Internet through nanobots (which can stealthily enter an animal&#8217;s body through the mouth, nose, ears, et cetera and are consequently absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to every cell in that animal&#8217;s body as objects which are small enough to pass through the pores of cellular membranes). Those nanobots convert neuronal impulses and chemical messages into digital signals and transmit those digital signals as electromagnetic waves (which are picked up by stealthy router drones and stationary routers in the environment. Each of the routers amplify the electromagnetic signals such that those are strong enough to be detected by the next router as each discrete data packet is transferred down a chain of routers to supercomputer server farms where the data packets are assembled into larger and more complex software objects to be analyzed in a large-scale &#8216;real time&#8217; virtual model of Earth&#8217;s biosphere. After analyzing the biological inputs, server farms send back messages which control the nanobots inside of animals in a backwards-propagating chain of electromagnetic waves until those signals reach their corresponding animal-implanted nanobots. The overall result is a dynamic circular propagation of biological data and electronic/photonic computer analysis. In poetic terms, the Internet is an interpenetrating gaze into finite eyes and infinite stares; and within the Internet models, there is a hollowness which seems to be the the void seeing through the eyes of every &#8216;sufficiently complex&#8217; animal on Planet Earth.&#8221; &#8211; Anonymous</p>

<p>&#8216;Shaktipat or Śaktipāta (Sanskrit, from shakti &#8220;(psychic) energy&#8221; and pāta, &#8220;to fall&#8221;)[1] refers in Hinduism to the transmission (or conferring) of spiritual energy upon one person by another. Shaktipat can be transmitted with a sacred word or mantra, or by a look, thought or touch – the last usually to the ajna chakra or agya chakra or third eye of the recipient.</p>
<p>Saktipat is considered an act of grace (anugraha) on the part of the guru or the divine. It cannot be imposed by force, nor can a receiver make it happen.[2] The very consciousness of the god or guru is held to enter into the Self of the disciple, constituting an initiation into the school or the spiritual family (kula) of the guru.[3] It is held that Shaktipat can be transmitted in person or at a distance, through an object such as a flower or fruit.&#8217; &#8211; Wikipedia</p>
