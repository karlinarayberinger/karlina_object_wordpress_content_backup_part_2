EXILED_FROM_UNIVERSITY

<hr>

Either get knocked up (as in pregnant and/or pushed into prostitution or else "married" into some anti-individualistic cult of kin who all adhere to the same anti-intellectual priorities) or else knocked out (as in forcibly evicted, incarcerated, or physically assaulted) seems to the standard way the tyrannical pugs of California State University East Bay in Hayward filter the adults into what are deemed to be socially-acceptable categories. 

Loners and intellectuals are not welcome on that campus (and not really in the encompassing city of Hayward either). It seems that Hispanics are particularly antagonistic towards my independence from family and my preference to focus on natural sciences rather than humanaites. The only work that seems to be recognized as legitimate by such people seems to be the kind of work which does not involve much capacity for abstract reasoning, sophisticated logic, tolerance for diverse opinions, and solitude. 

That is why such people need to be treated as addicted to an unnecessary and dangerously high amount of sensationalist drama and means of living which wreck havoc on the environment and on intellectual progress (especially in the realms of natural science and secular philosophy). 

Such people seem to take their troubles with them from their corrupt country of origin (e.g. Mexico) and let such a burdenous shadow of corrupt political priorities poison the otherwise prosperous spaces for free thought, intelligent (and respectful) discussion, non-trivial creativity (i.e. not preschool-level busy work doodling and tooting one's unoriginal horn), scientific research (especially the natural sciences and not just psychology (which is pseudoscience in my opinion)), and holistic health (rather than partaking in physical exercise for merely superficial reasons (i.e. to improve and to maintain one's sexual attractiveness (since sex is forced into the front of everyone's consciousness who attempts to make a living in such a place because sex is the primary industry to expand the population of pugs so that they may reign supreme by sheer strength in numbers and brutish control tactics)).

I strongly believe that such people are intolerably envious and insecure when they see me sitting by myself on campus either to meditate, relax, or, most controversial of all, use a laptop to share my ideas with the world (throuh the medium of a public blog and social media which minimizes censorship (because its users are presumed to be mature adults and not overgrown children who need to make the entire world childproofed for their cowardice and convenience)). Such people seem to be intimidated by my relative aptitude and love of working and want to lower my standard of living as punishment for the "crime" of making them look primitive in comparison (to the point that they call my peaceful, unburdensome existence, and even philanthropic existence a disruption of orderly conduct and an excuse to call the police like insecure children crying to Big Papa that one of the kids seems to be getting more free cake than most of the other adult children are).

Today, I was corraled by the sanitation crew in the science building where I have been working. When I went upstairs to get away from the crew, I saw a pug sitting in an office chair staring me down from across the way like he was expecting me to show up. His body language communicated a haughty one-upmanship that is characteristic of chauvinist cultural norms among such people. A woman's place is obvioiusly in the home or in some menial, low-skilled job. I think the pugs want me to go home and stay in the shadow of Mommy, Daddy, and be some babysitter of the kids of the neighborhood (like a good Hispanic would). Apparently, they want me to switch my career path from computer science (and/or physical sciences) to early childhood development and youth management as some kind of nanny, counselor, or elementary-level teacher. I have zero desire to work with kids, pets, or people. I want to stick to my chosen path of systems over socializing.

Anyway, shortly after I found a place out of the way of the sanitation crew to work on my blog, the campus police showed up and issued me a written warning saying that, if I show up on campus within the next seven days, I will be arrested (i.e. locked up in a cage for committing a lawful misdemeanor). The police were particularly grouchy today and kept suggesting that I belong nowhere better than some homeless shelter (where all I do is hug my knees and wait to be shoved into some kind of group home where I would likely be expected to conform to poor, stupid, and religious bums with no privacy and with no solitude). 

After getting this pink slip for the crime of existing in a space where only pugs are welcome, I do not plan on returning to CSUEB campus ever again. Instead, I will go to the free public electrical outlets of various BART parking garages and, if that fails, my parents' houses (which I avoid doing because my parents seem to have an agenda to metaphorically cut off my testicles and turn me into a weepy stay-at-home waif who settles for being subjugated under the tyranny of the pug's patriarchal cultural stereotypes).

As a result of my eviction from campus and refusal to be confined to a household where I lack privacy (and where I feel discouraged from being overtly (and even covertly) happy, smart, and strong), I will have to inhale more poisonous car fumes than I want to, endure more distracting environmental disturbances than I want to, and work much more slowly and inefficiently than I want to (because my mobile Internet bandwidth is small and because I tend to get kicked around by police and civillians when I occupy a decent location for "too long").

Thank you, pugs, for helping to keep me from being "too complacent" and "too happy". Thank you for training me to curb my enthusiasm for your benefit. Thank you for teaching me how to better accomodate your normalized "disability". I will do my best to avoid offending you, your grace.
