Some average minimum number of photons, N, is expected to strike Earth's surface each year. 

(Note that the surface area of Planet Earth is some fixed number of square meters and the number of photons which strikes that surface each day of Earth's orbit around the sun changes depending on where Earth is located in its eliptical orbit and how Earth is tilted with respect to the sun. Cloud cover is probably the most significant factor which introduces randomness to the equations used to predict the number of photons which strike Earth's surface on any particular day (yet computer models are assumed to be getting better at minimizing such randomness by making global climate patterns increasingly predictable as the number of input variables and empirical measurements increase towards an indefinitely large data set)).

Given that N is a natural number which is assumed to be fairly constant, N can be used as the basis for establishing a stable "gold standard" for a new kind of currency whose unit value does not fluctuate in monetary worth even as human population increases and supply and demand of various marketable assets changes.
