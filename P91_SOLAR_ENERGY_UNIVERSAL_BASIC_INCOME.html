Some average minimum number of photons, N, is expected to strike Earth's surface each year. 

(Note that the surface area of Planet Earth is some fixed number of square meters and the number of photons which strikes that surface each day of Earth's orbit around the sun changes depending on where Earth is located in its eliptical orbit and how Earth is tilted with respect to the sun. Cloud cover is probably the most significant factor which introduces randomness to the equations used to predict the number of photons which strike Earth's surface on any particular day (yet computer models are assumed to be getting better at minimizing such randomness by making global climate patterns increasingly predictable as the number of input variables and empirical measurements increase towards an indefinitely large data set)).

Given that N is a natural number which is assumed to be fairly constant, N can be used as the basis for establishing a stable "gold standard" for a new kind of currency whose unit value does not fluctuate in monetary worth even as human population increases (or decreases) and, somewhat consequentially, as the supply and demand for various marketable assets change. 

Also, the more photovoltaic cells there are on Planet Earth (and elsewhere) available to convert incoming solar electromagnetic radiation (i.e. light) to some linearly proportional number of electrons (i.e. electricity which can be used to power global computer networks which "mint" yearly currency tokens out of sunlight and distribute them in a systemic and decentralized manner such that each person receives a predictable fixed amount of such tokens, T, each year), the total number of active photovoltaic cells can increase in number each year and any of those photovoltaic cells could increase in photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency such that T may be able to increase over time (or, at the very least, stay the same).

If each person is issued exactly T (newly minted) solar energy tokens per year at the beginning of each year (regardless of how many of such tokens any given person has saved up in the bank from the previous year), each person is presumably guaranteed to have a fixed minimal basic income which should be sufficient to pay for basic living expenses. Such tokens can be transferred from one person to another as gifts and as payments for goods and services. Such tokens can also be used in betting games, gambling, and rewards for winning competitions or for achieving notable feats of genius or philanthropy.
