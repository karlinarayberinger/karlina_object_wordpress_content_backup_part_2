Some average minimum number of photons, N, is expected to strike Earth's surface each year. 

(Note that the surface area of Planet Earth is some fixed number of square meters and the number of photons which strikes that surface each day of Earth's orbit around the sun changes depending on where Earth is located in its eliptical orbit and how Earth is tilted with respect to the sun such that distribution of photons which reach the northern and southern hemisphere of the spherical Earth change in a very predictable and formulaic way).
