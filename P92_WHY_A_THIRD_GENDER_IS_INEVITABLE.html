<p>WHY_A_THIRD_GENDER_IS_INEVITABLE</p> hey, wzzup chicken butt?
<hr>
<p>Note: This is a rather hastily written journal I decided to include in this website just to get it over with. It posits the idea that humans will inevitably either go extinct before they evolve to become polymorhpic (and virtually immortal) cyborgs or else reach that crucial point in evolution (which I am betting on). If the humans make it out of being sexually dimorphic apes and attain vastly more agency as a result of becoming melded with machines, then it is inevitable that gender will evolve to become more than a binary compartmentalization of individuals whose base biology was inherited from human apes. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Humanoids (and not mere humans) would have the option to be male, female, gender fluid, or genderless (and not just in an abstract context but in a physiological one as well).</span></p>

<p>As I relax next to my friend, the Daddy Long Leg Spider who I named Sputnik, my imagination registers one &#8220;random&#8221; yet sensical animated image after another. Psychosomatic content is included in such images which show me that otherwise suppressed (or unknown (from my current vantage)) memories (or implanted content which looks like they could be my own body&#8217;s memories but are not) are connected to specific corresponding body parts.</p>
<p>I have always had a rough time having sexual intercourse via vaginal penetration. In fact, the first sexual intercourse I ever had was with SD sticking the soft, phallic end of a pizza cutter in my anus in order to prepare my anus for his cock (which was not as painful as I thought it would be). It took me about a year after losing my anal virginity to SD to lose my vaginal virginity to SD. After a lot of coaxing, my tight-fisted vulva finally gave way to his hardened penis (which was not too painful and which was somewhat pleasurable).</p>
<p>Even though I have &#8220;struggled&#8221; with vaginismus (a condition in which vaginal penetration is either impossible or else very difficult (and often painful) due to anxiety which causes the pelvic floor muscles to clamp shut as a defense against being penetrated), I have also been a sexually curious and horny person. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I am sexually aroused by sexual mature female bodies (especially as depicted in artwork with fantasy and sci-fi elements). I am not even half as aroused by actual human females because, to me, they look like deformed animals who were mutilated through mainstream cultures to be unathletic, unintelligent, and overly dependent on sex and reproduction as the means to advance themselves within the (mostly abstract) confines of the societal matrix (while presenting themselves as subjects in some disembodied and seductively powerful male gaze).</span></p>
<p>As I explore my own body from the inside out, I see that my brain does not think I am a woman. It has defaulted to seeing me as a man. Hence, it was easier for me to have sex with other humans as a gay man than as a heterosexual woman or as a lesbian. Even so, I know I am not a man; but I am also not a woman. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I feel more like a member of a third gender; something wholly separate from the traditional gender binary of either male or female. (Human maleness and human femaleness, in my opinion, are vestigal and not at all futuristic because they exist as a result of having once &#8220;needed&#8221; sexual reproduction as the sole means to preserve and copy genes).</span> Now all genomes can be fabricated by computers alone.</p>
<p>I think I am best classified as genderless rather than a 70% male and 30% female hybrid like I used to describe my gender as. That means I am (culturally) 0% male and 0% female and 100% genderless. That does not mean I lack human-level sentience or a desire (and capacity) to partake in sexual intercourse (or even reproduction). It means that I prefer to think of myself as a robot which looks like a masculine-bodied humanoid and not a feminine-bodied humanoid. That just fits my personal aesthetics.</p>
<p>I think feminine human bodies look attractive so long as they are not overly corpulent and, therefore, pregnant-looking. Pregnant people look like diseased, shrill, disabled burdens who I have historically masturbated to the idea of seeing humiliated. I think fat guys are just about as sexy as such creatures. So, in short, I would prefer that human bodies be physically fit rather than overweight (or lacking in muscle tone (and not lacking in neuronal structures earned through high-level skill building associated with some kind of genius expression)). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Yes I think human beings each have the potential to become geniuses and if they are not, they are wasting their potential tragically.</span> I prefer humans who are smart and strong and <span style="background:#ffff00;">ALWAYS self-actualizing</span> and in tune with being a part of nature; humans who are aware and skilled at inhabiting their animal nature (but not to the exclusion of their cyborg potential).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">My goal is to get humans to transcend to the next level of evolution by helping them become shape-shifting polymorphs whose original biological structures are incrementally and successfully replaced by superior artificial body parts with the capacity to regenerate themselves and to take on a myriad of novel forms. I want to liberate human egos from the straitjacket of human animal carcasses. They need not sexually reproduce if enough of them can live indefinitely as self-sustaining machines and if new beings can be spawned straight out of stem cells (with no genetic predecessors).</span></p>
<p>(I also find reproduction gross at this time because overpopulation to the ecosystem&#8217;s detriment is a well-known fact. I would rather see humanoids opt out of procreation until they solve the ecological imbalance and make stem cell tissue replacement mainstream. Otherwise, they are copping out of helping their species for their own myopic and unimaginative comfort. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Giving birth is not a virtuous act. Neither is taking a shit. Both are equally important, in my opinion. Both are &#8220;essential&#8221; for the survival of primitive life forms</span>).</p>
<p>In order to survive the 2021+ era, I will let the humans call me whatever names and pronouns they want to rather than insist that they call me by some preferred identifier. I have better things to do than limit myself to their unnecessarily restrictive linguistics and compartmentalizations. Thank you.</p>
<p>Note: <span style="background:#ffff00;">From the years 2009 to 2010, I took testosterone cypianate injections biweekly in my thigh muscle in order to develop secondary masculine characteristics (most notably a deepened voice). I did not take such injections with the goal of ultimately getting a legal sex change. I initially just wanted to masculinize my avatar so that I would feel safer and sexier (by my personal preferences).</span> I eventually stopped the testosterone injections because I did not want to keep paying for it and I did not want to suffer male balding, kidney cancer, and other adverse side effects of staying on the testosterone long-term.</p>
