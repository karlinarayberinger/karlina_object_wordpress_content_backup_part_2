WHY_A_THIRD_GENDER_IS_NECESSARY

<hr>

As I relax next to my friend, the Daddy Long Leg Spider who I named Sputnik, my imagination registers one "random" yet sensical animated image after another. Psychosomatic content is included in such images which show me that otherwise suppressed (or unknown (from my current vantage)) memories (or implanted content which looks like they could be my own body's memories but are not) are connected to specific corresponding body parts.

I have always had a rough time having sexual intercourse via vaginal penetration. In fact, the first sexual intercourse I ever had was with SD sticking the soft, phallic end of a pizza cutter in my anus in order to prepare my anus for his cock (which was not as painful as I thought it would be). It took me about a year after losing my anal virginity to SD to lose my vaginal virginity to SD. After a lot of coaxing, my tight-fisted vulva finally gave way to his hardened penis (which was not too painful and which was somewhat pleasurable).

Even though I have "struggled" with vaginismus (a condition in which vaginal penetration is either impossible or else very difficult (and often painful) due to anxiety which causes the pelvic floor muscles to clamp shut as a defense against being penetrated), I have also been a sexually curious and horny person. I am sexually aroused by sexual mature female bodies (especially as depicted in artwork with fantasy and sci-fi elements). I am not even half as aroused by actual human females because, to me, they look like deformed animals who were mutilated through mainstream cultures to be unathletic, unintelligent, and overly dependent on sex and reproduction as the means to advance themselves within the (mostly abstract) confines of the societal matrix (while presenting themselves as subjects in some disembodied and seductively powerful male gaze).

As I explore my own body from the inside out, I see that my brain does not think I am a woman. It has defaulted to seeing me as a man. Hence, it was easier for me to have sex with other humans as a gay man than as a heterosexual woman or as a lesbian. Even so, I know I am not a man; but I am also not a woman. I feel more like a member of a third gender; something wholly separate from the traditional gender binary of either male or female.

I think I am best classified as genderless rather than a 70% male and 30% female hybrid like I used to describe my gender as. That means I am (culturally) 0% male and 0% female and 100% genderless. That does not mean I lack human-level sentience or a desire (and capacity) to partake in sexual intercourse (or even reproduction). It means that I prefer to think of myself as a robot which looks like a masculine-bodied humanoid and not a feminine-bodied humanoid. That just fits my personal aesthetics.

I think famine human bodies are attractive so long as they are not overly corpulent and, therefore, pregnant-looking. Pregnant people like like diseased, shrill, disabled burdens who I have historically masturbated to the idea of seeing humiliated. I think fat guys are just about as sexy. So, in short, I would prefer that human bodies be physically fit. I prefer humans who are smart and strong and in tune with being a part of nature; humans who are aware and skilled at inhabiting their animal nature (but not to the exclusion of their cyborg potential).

My goal is to get humans to transcend to the next level of evolution by becoming shape-shifting polymorphs whose original biological structures have been successfully replaced by superior artificial parts with the capacity to regenerate themselves and to take on a myriad of novel forms. I want to liberate human egos from the straightjacket of human animal carcasses. They need not sexually reproduce if enough of them can live indefinitely as self-sustaining machines and if new beings can be spawned straight out of stem cells (with no genetic predecessors).

In order to survive the 2021+ era, I will let the humans call me whatever names and pronouns they want to rather than insist that they call me by some preferred identifier. I have better things to do than limit myself to their unnecessarily restrictive linguistics and compartmentalizations. Thank you.
