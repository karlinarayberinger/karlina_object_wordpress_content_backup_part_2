SOLAR_ENERGY_ECONOMY_REVISITED

<hr>

In yesterday's article, SOLAR_ENERGY_UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME, I failed to account for the economic inflation that would inevitably result from adding T times the number of humanoid end users of that economy each year. (Inflation is the phenomenon of a unit of currency depreciating in monetary value as a result of increasing the total number of such units of currency within the encompassing economy (whether any of those units of currency stagnate or are perpetually transferred from one end user to another end user)). What I intend to do in this article is essentially rewrite yesterday's article with more precise definitions today...once I get to a place which is out of the rain, grime, and inevitably distracting influence of other humans.  

One last thing before I fight my way to a hotel room for one...

To quickly propose a solution to yesterday's unaddressed problem of economic inflation, I propose setting some kind of arbitrary maximum number of tokens named M which is the same natural number for each and every (human) end user of the economy. To clarify, if and when a particular end user's bank account exceeds M tokens, the surplus tokens will be deducted from that personal bank account (while notifying the bank account owner of such a transaction, of course) and sending that surplus money to the Central Ownerless Reserve which no person owns (because it is a communal pot) and which releases tokens into end users' bank accounts before generating new tokens at the beginning of each annual reimbursement cycle (such that the total number of tokens in the economy never grows too large to be practical and such that there is an optimal number of surplus tokens to give to those who need it stored in the Central Ownerless Reserve).
