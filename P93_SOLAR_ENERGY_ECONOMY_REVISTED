SOLAR_ENERGY_ECONOMY_REVISITED

<hr>

In yesterday's article, SOLAR_ENERGY_UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME, I failed to account for the economic inflation that would inevitably result from adding T times the number of humanoid end users of that economy each year. (Inflation is the phenomenon of a unit of currency depreciating in monetary value as a result of increasing the total number of such units of currency within the encompassing economy (whether any of those units of currency stagnate or are perpetually transferred from one end user to another end user)). What I intend to do in this article is essentially rewrite yesterday's article with more precise definitions today...once I get to a place which is out of the rain, grime, and inevitably distracting influence of other humans.  

One last thing before I fight my way to a hotel room for one...

To quickly propose a solution to yesterday's unaddressed problem of economic inflation, I propose setting some kind of arbitrary maximum number of tokens named M which is the same natural number for each and every (human) end user of the economy. To clarify, if and when a particular end user's bank account exceeds M tokens, the surplus tokens will be deducted from that personal bank account (while notifying the bank account owner of such a transaction, of course) and sending that surplus money to the Central Ownerless Reserve which no person owns (because it is a communal pot) and which releases tokens into end users' bank accounts before generating new tokens at the beginning of each annual reimbursement cycle (such that the total number of tokens in the economy never grows too large to be practical and such that there is an optimal number of surplus tokens to give to those who need it stored in the Central Ownerless Reserve).

One last note before I cut this one off and just make PAGE_94 the page where I really go balls to the wall to make a revolutionary proposal to upgrade the economy....

My father deserves to be singled out as perhaps the single-most destructive influence on my progress to date. No one else in my life (strangers included) is even half as sexist and old-fashioned as he is as far as I can discern. My father has been an antagonistic bully while pretending to be innocent and supportive. He has stolen my backpack (which contained my laptop and sleeping bag) as punishment for leaving Santa Rita Jail without using him as my escort. My father wanted to throw me out of his house (which is legally my house as well) and prevent me from getting a decent career, lifestyle, and even space to relax such that I was forced to operate at a much lower level of functioning than necessary and to the detriment of my physical and mental health. If I seriously tried to use my father's house as an office space, I know from ample experience that my father would try to antagonize me and insinuate that I am not doing enough to look distressed, distracted, and hyper self-conscious. Most notably, while I was most down and out economically speaking (and exhausted from working over time), my father would stand in my way as soon as I got home and tried to badger me into talking to him as though my life outside his vicinity was functionally nonexistent. He demanded that I be obsessively preoccupied with acquiring and consuming food as a coping mechanism and as a distraction from higher-level thought. I love my parents and do not want them to suffer any more than necessary, but I need to get this out that I stay away from my mom and dad for a reason: they keep trying to make me play dumb for their benefit. They implicitly demand that I settle for feigning disability just to save them money and to keep them from feeling jealous and excluded from my life. Now is not the time to bicker and to escalate conflict unnecessarily. Now is the time to apologize for being wasteful and prejudiced...and to, as quickly as possible, move the fuck on. I do not mind making a fool of myself in public because I sincerely trust in humanity's good nature. I believe there is more right with us as a species than wrong. I want to be more supportive to the community which has supported me in my time of need while I am able to (because I have a temporary window of opportunity to use the $400 from my latest federal tax refund deposit to rent a motel room and to hammer out a refined model of a solar energy economy which makes sense to as many people as possible and not just the plutocrats with all the money they need to insulate themselves from my sense of urgency). I do not expect very many residents and vagrants of "Ho Town" to appreciate my efforts until they personally reap the benefits (if ever). Hence, I wait for no person's love. Nature is all I need to propel me forward in my creative journey.

Again, "one last thing" before I go into mobile lockdown mode as I struggle towards my destination...

Praise the fucking lord I am able to use this holy public bathroom at Safeway to shit and make this note simultaneously. My god, the caliber of conversations I am overhearing from the locals is atrociously banal. This place is populated by people who appear to make their money pretending to enjoy helping the government procrastinate on making pollution-free energy (and self-driving affordable taxis) the norm. Humans are shitty drivers. There would be dramatically fewer automobile accidents and far less traffic (and POLLUTION) if robots robots instead of humans drove. I am sick of the egotistical norms of the paid-to-procrastinate (and over consume) masses making the otherwise clean, efficient, and enjoyable economy gridlocked with animalistic anxiety and aggression. I see it in the streets. I inhale it in my lungs. I hear it as nonstop chatter from monkeys who seem to want me to feign disability just so I stay at home and out of their vicinity so they can continue living their dysfunctional lives without me there to disrupt them. In public, I expend quite a lot of effort just trying not to draw attention to myself as I go about my day as efficiently and as effectively as possible. I think people deliberately try to make me act out in theatrical ways for their amusement and cathartic relief. So, nope, I am not a big fan of the people of "Ho Town". They are an ungrateful, lazy, and cowardly bunch who seem to default to waiting to be waited on by comparatively wealthy and charismatic politicians like a bunch of attention-deficit children. Just stay out of my way if you want to help me. I do my best to stay out of yours. Thank you for your understanding. I will do my best to work for the common welfare whether any of you rats appreciate it or not. Over and out.
