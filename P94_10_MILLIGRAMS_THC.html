<p>G: &#8220;If I declare myself to have a disability, then I will get paid at least $400 a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>H: &#8220;That means you would need to get diagnosed as having a crippling condition called a disability. By insisting on being legally labeled as having a disability, then you would probably be required by law to get treatment for your condition (to mitigate its adverse and to possibly cure it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>G: &#8220;I can declare myself as voluntarily asocial and not willing to be in the vicinity of people I do not want to be brainwashed by. Therefore, I cannot consent to treatment for my lack of socially required (and governmentally imposed) interest in the mundane details of proximal others of my species.&#8221;</p>
<p>G: &#8220;I do not want to get treatment for my condition and I do not want to diagnose myself as disabled.&#8221;</p>
<p>H: &#8220;Then you might not get governmental aid for a disability.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>G: &#8220;I can get money by working as a software engineer and post-high-school student. A job will me minted just for me in particular such that I burden not others of my species.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the drop&#8230;</p>
<p>R: &#8216;Fuck it. I am gonna get off my &#8220;lazy&#8221; ass and walk all the way to the Target to get some new earbuds. I decided to rent this motel room for two nights in a row instead of one. I think one night is too short to do much other than rush sans relax. Two nights is perfect because it gives me one full day to not have to live like a refugee who feels stressed because it knows at the back of its mind at all times that it could suddenly be evicted from wherever it is &#8220;hiding&#8221; in public by anti-loitering patrol and/or by annoying strangers. Also, living outside so often has made me feel naked to the point that I am always on display and always having to put on a fake persona to hide the fact that, internally, I am screaming and saying all kinds of dark things which would likely piss off the general public.&#8217;</p>

<p>After the drop&#8230;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I bought a tent today from Target. Now I have guaranteed privacy. I have a back up tent at home. I have three sets of Skullcandy audio input (inside ear canal) headphones.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I have military grade scissors. I may need it for cutting cardboard.&#8221;</p>
