G: "If I declare myself to have a disability, then I will get paid at least $400 a month."

H: "That means you would need to get diagnosed as having a crippling condition called a disability. By insisting on being legally labeled as having a disability, then you would probably be required by law to get treatment for your condition (to mitigate its adverse and to possibly cure it)."

<hr>

G: "I can declare myself as voluntarily asocial and not willing to be in the vicinity of people I do not want to be brainwashed by. Therefore, I cannot consent to treatment for my lack of socially required (and governmentally imposed) interest in the mundane details of proximal others of my species."

G: "I do not want to get treatment for my condition and I do not want to diagnose myself as disabled."

H: "Then you might not get goverental aid for a disability."

<hr>

G: "I can get money by working as a software engineer and post-hifhschool student. A job will me minted just for me in particular such that I burden not others of my species."

INTRINSIC_VALUE

* * *

PERSON_Z: “Suppose that somebody (i.e. a humanoid named PERSON_X) other than yourself (and you are a humanoid named PERSON_Y) has been intercepting each of your brain’s original thoughts in succession before your allotment of awareness has time to consciously register such thoughts and, as soon as PERSON_X receives a copy of each of your thoughts, PERSON_X immediately and automatically transcribes each of those thought copies in succession and verbatim into a digital format which appears as publicly visible text (and visual images, sounds, and other multi-sensory media formats) on a public website which PERSON_X claims as its own original intellectual property (and PERSON_X licenses such intellectual property as proprietary material which is illegal for any person other than PERSON_X to publish copies of and to claim as one’s own original work). Would you still keep publishing your own thoughts on your own public website?”

PERSON_Y: “Yes. Of course I would keep publishing my own ideas on my own blog. Why would I not?”

PERSON_Z: “According to some large committee of humanoids (i.e. GROUP_A) who democratically vote on which humanoid activities are legally permissible and which humanoid activities are not legally permissible, your blog is considered to be a waste of community resources (i.e. communications infrastructure and cognitive bandwidth) because your job as a philosophy blogger has been deemed to be legally outsourced to the rich, famous, and esteemed philosophy blogger named PERSON_X (since the legal system, as defined by GROUP_A) treats an original work of art as belonging to the first person to publish that work of art under a proprietary (i.e. not open-source) license rather than the first person to generate such thoughts.”

PERSON_Y: “Even if publishing my own original thoughts on my own public blog were deemed by GROUP_A to be illegal, I would still do it anyway because I derive intrinsic value in the form of self-esteem from the activity of writing, publishing, and reading my own original work on my own public blog (even if PERSON_X’s blog gets significantly more page views, praise, and monetary donations from the general public than my blog does).”

PERSON_Z: “Suppose your blog got removed from the Internet by GROUP_A’s information technology task force due to copyright infringement. What would you do then?”

PERSON_Y: “I would still keep trying to launch one website after another in order to share my ideas with the world.”

PERSON_Z: “Suppose GROUP_A’s information technology task force banned you from using the Internet and locked you up in maximum security prison for the rest of your life under the criminal charge that you are indeed a repeat offender of legal copyright infringement?”

PERSON_X: “As disappointing as that would be for me, I would do my best to make the most of my prison sentence by using it as an opportunity to become a well-practiced monk who spends most of its time meditating and doing yoga.”

PERSON_Z: “Suppose that GROUP_A’s criminal justice league sentenced you to being physically restrained by brain-to-computer interfacing devices which turn off your non-vital motor functions such that you are forced to live as a fully paralyzed yet fully conscious prisoner whose thoughts are mined, filtered, and sold in parts to whoever the highest bidder is.”

PERSON_X: “As bleak and as limiting as my life would be at that point, I would nevertheless commit myself to the humbling task of serving up the highest-quality insights I can to those who want them.”

PERSON_Z: “Good job. You passed the moral integrity test according to GROUP_A.”

CONSCIENTIOUS_OMNIVORE

What came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg came first because it is a single-called organism (i.e. prokaryote) instead of a more evolutionarily complex multi-cellular organism (i.e. eukaryote). The egg is assumed to have less sentience bound up in its form than a chicken is. Therefore, eating the egg is the “lesser of the two evils” (if consuming animal products is a sin (and vegans, by definition, classify all animal products as sinful to purchase, consume, and promote)).

What about eggs which were laid by chickens who were not locked up in cages? What about milk which was pumped from goats and cattle who were not forcibly raped (by humans with insemination sticks) to keep lactating? What about synthetic stem-cell derived animal products? What about plant-based replicas of animal products? What about means of farming which do not require clearing out rain forests and releasing tons of carbon, methane, carcinogenic molecules, and other ecologically-destabilizing and health-hazardous waste into the atmosphere, waters, and soils? Must so-called healthy food be manufactured in ways which depend on slave labor, warfare, and the torturing of sentient creatures?

Why would health be worth such a hefty cost to the system which sustains the so-called health-conscious end user if that system ultimately destroys every point of the system (end user included)? As long as I think I have a window of opportunity to enjoy my hamburger before the ecological apocalypse happens (which is spurred on by the hamburger industry), I will just say that my ecological impact is negligible and eat my hamburger with pride and contentment while ignoring any news which makes me feel uncomfortable about my choices as a consumer. (I am being facetious. This is what playing devil’s advocate looks like).

As much as I have tried to minimize my investment in the suffering of animals, there comes a point in which my own welfare as an animal takes precedence over my prey (because, if I were left to fend for myself in the wilderness, I would voluntarily default to being a predator rather than default to being someone else’s prey if my bodily survival required that I hunt and kill simpler animals for nourishment and inflict bodily harm upon predators of any species who threaten my bodily survival). I now grant myself permission to be a conscious (and, therefore, conscientious) omnivore; one who strives to minimize investing in and subsisting on products and industries which harm sentient creatures. I will do my best to maximize the vegan to non-vegan ratio of my diet to minimize my negative ecological impact (since the meat industry tends to be quite ecologically taxing compared to the plant-based foods industry).

SOLAR_ENERGY_UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME

* * *

Some average minimum number of photons, N, is expected to strike Earth’s surface each year.

(Note that the surface area of Planet Earth is some fixed number of square meters and the number of photons which strikes that surface each day of Earth’s orbit around the sun changes depending on where Earth is located in its elliptical orbit and how Earth is tilted with respect to the sun. Cloud cover is probably the most significant factor which introduces randomness to the equations used to predict the number of photons which strike Earth’s surface on any particular day (yet computer models are assumed to be getting better at minimizing such randomness by making global climate patterns increasingly predictable as the number of input variables and empirical measurements increase towards an indefinitely large data set)).

Given that N is a natural number which is assumed to be fairly constant, N can be used as the basis for establishing a stable “gold standard” for a new kind of currency whose unit value does not fluctuate in monetary worth even as human population increases (or decreases) and, somewhat consequentially, as the supply and demand for various marketable assets change.

Also, the more photovoltaic cells there are on Planet Earth (and elsewhere) available to convert incoming solar electromagnetic radiation (i.e. light) to some linearly proportional number of electrons (i.e. electricity which can be used to power global computer networks which “mint” yearly currency tokens out of sunlight and distribute them in a systemic and decentralized manner such that each person receives a predictable fixed amount of such tokens, T, each year), the total number of active photovoltaic cells can increase in number each year and any of those photovoltaic cells could increase in photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency such that T may be able to increase over time (or, at the very least, stay the same).

If each person is issued exactly T (newly minted) solar energy tokens per year at the beginning of each year (regardless of how many of such tokens any given person has saved up in the bank from the previous year), each person is presumably guaranteed to have a fixed minimal basic income which should be sufficient to pay for basic living expenses. Such tokens can be transferred from one person to another as gifts and as payments for goods and services. Such tokens can also be used in betting games as jackpot winnings and as rewards for for achieving notable feats of genius, athleticism, artistry, or philanthropy.

So, whether of not any person works in exchange for monetary income, each person is guaranteed to have no fewer than T tokens as a government-issued stimulus check each year (and the value of such tokens is the product of the physical work which is performed by the photovoltaic cells and tokens distribution system). Humans need not have to perform any physical (or abstract) work to earn that bare minimum of T tokens at the beginning of each year. All that person must do is be alive!

(Note that physical work is a measure of the amount of force applied to cause some object with mass to be displaced across some finite length of space (and within a finite length of time). When photons strike the surface of photovoltaic cells, electrons are bumped out of their orbits around the nucleus of atoms which comprise the metallic layer of the photovoltaic cell (which is physical work)).

Fuck it. I am gonna get off my "lazy" ass and walk all the way to the Target to get some new earbuds. I decided to rent this motel room for two nights in a row instead of one. I think one night is too short to do much other than rush sans relax. Two nights is perfect because it gives me one full day to not have to live like a refugee who feels stressed because it knows at the back of its mind at all times that it could suddenly be evicted from wherever it is "hiding" in public by anti-loitering patrol and/or by annoying strangers. Also, living outside so often has made me feel naked to the point that I am always on display and always having to put on a fake persona to hide the fact that, internally, I am screaming and saying all kinds of dark things which would likely piss off the general public."
