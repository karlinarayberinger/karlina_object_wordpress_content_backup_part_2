<p><strong>photons:</strong> a natural number quantity which represents some empirically observed quantity of photons (i.e. irreducible particles of light).</p>
<p><strong>electrons:</strong> a natural number quantity which represents some empirically observed quantity of electrons (i.e. irreducible particles of electricity).</p>
<p><strong>E:</strong> a natural number representing the average daily number of joules of energy generated by all functional photovoltaic cells in the Solar Based Economy system.</p>
<pre>let E = electricity_in_joules(electrons); 
// electrons are from photovoltaic cells
// E represents total photovoltaic output generated during a particular year.</pre>
<p><strong>P:</strong> a natural number representing the total number of end users (i.e. persons) of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong> a natural number representing the total number of personal bank accounts which serve as decentralized end points of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>
<p>(Each end user of the Solar Based Economy system has exactly one unique personal bank account which is not shared with any other user of the system).</p>

<p><strong>PART_1: Abstract Quantities of the System</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which is used as a scaling coefficient.</p>
<p><strong>N:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which represents the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within the system.</p>
<p>(N is a function which takes E as an input and which rounds E down to the nearest integer (i.e. a whole number greater than or equal to zero) and multiplied by A.</p>
<pre>let N = round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A); 
// N is the total number of tokens created during a particular year</pre>
<p><strong>T:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which represents the minimum number of Solar Energy Tokens to newly generate and consequently distribute to each one of the P personal bank accounts which serve as decentralized end points of the Solar Based Economy system at midnight on the first day of each new year.</p>
<pre>let T = (N / P); 
// T is the annual basic income for each person</pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>PART_2: Logical Features of the System</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>With each successive year, (T * P) new Solar Energy Tokens are added to the Solar Based Economy system such that the total number of tokens increments by roughly N per year.</p>
<pre>N += N; 
// closed system simulation</pre>
<pre>N = (N + N); 
// closed system simulation</pre>
<pre>N += round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A); 
// empirical input, E, introduces randomness</pre>
<pre>N = N + round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A); 
// empirical input, E, introduce randomness</pre>
<p>The number of electrons (i.e. irreducible particles of electricity) which are ejected from a photovoltaic cell are directly proportional to the number of photons (i.e. irreducible particles of light) which strike the ionic surface of the photovoltaic cell.</p>
<pre>let electrons = photovoltaic_conversion(photons); 
// photons are from sunlight</pre>
<pre>let E = electricity_in_joules(electrons); 
// electrons are from photovoltaic cells</pre>
