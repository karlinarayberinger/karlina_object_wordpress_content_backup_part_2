<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">E:</strong> a natural number representing the average daily number of joules of energy generated by all functional photovoltaic cells in the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">P:</strong> a natural number representing the total number of end users (i.e. persons) of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">P:</strong> a natural number representing the total number of personal bank accounts which serve as decentralized end points of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p>(Each end user of the Solar Based Economy system has exactly one unique personal bank account which is not shared with any other user of the system).</p>

<p><strong>PART_1: Abstract Quantities of the System</strong></p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">A:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which is used as a scaling coefficient.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">N:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which represents the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within the system.</p>

<p>(N is a function which takes E as an input and which rounds E down to the nearest integer (i.e. a whole number greater than or equal to zero) and multiplied by A.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;"><pre>let N = round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A);</pre></strong></p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">T:</strong> an arbitrary natural number which represents the minimum number of Solar Energy Tokens to newly generate and consequently distribute to each one of the P personal bank accounts which serve as decentralized end points of the Solar Based Economy system at midnight on the first day of each new year.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;"><pre>let T = (N / P);</pre></strong></p>

<p><strong>PART_2: Logical Features of the System</strong></p>

<p>With each successive year, (T * P) new Solar Energy Tokens are added to the Solar Based Economy system such that the total number of tokens increments by roughly N per year.<p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;"><pre>N += N;</pre></strong></p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;"><pre>N = (N + N);</pre></strong></p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;"><pre>N += round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A);</pre></strong></p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;"><pre>N = N + round_down_to_nearest_integer(E * A);</pre></strong></p>

<p>The number of electrons (i.e. irreducible particles of electricity) which are ejected from a photovoltaic cell are directly proportional to the number of photons (i.e. irreducible particles of light) which strike the ionic surface of the photovoltaic cell.</p>

<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;"><pre>let electrons = photovoltaic_conversion(photons);</pre></strong></p>
