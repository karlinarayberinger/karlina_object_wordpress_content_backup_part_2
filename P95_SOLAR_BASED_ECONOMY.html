<p>E: a natural number representing the average daily number of joules of energy generated by all functional photovoltaic cells in the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p>P: a natural number representing the total number of end users (i.e. persons) of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p>P: a natural number representing the total number of personal bank accounts which serve as decentralized end points of the Solar Based Economy system.</p>

<p>(Each end user of the Solar Based Economy system has exactly one unique personal bank account which is not shared with any other user of the system).</p>

<p><strong>PART_1: Abstract Quantities of the System</strong></p>

<p>A: an arbitrary natural number which is used as a scaling coefficient.</p>

<p>N: an arbitrary natural number which represents the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within the system.</p>

<p>(N is a function which takes E as an input and which rounds E down to the nearest integer (i.e. a whole number greater than or equal to zero).</p>
