HUMAN: "Hey spider on the wall. I see that you hardly do much other than eat and then sit in one place for weeks at a time. What are you doing during those periods of apparent intellectual dormancy?"

SPIDER: "My nervous system generates some apparently random natural number each time the number of joules (multiplied by A) of electricity which a microscopic receiver and transmitter picks up and sends to the nearest Wi-Fi Internet router (and where A is some real number quantity greater than 0) counts as either TRUE or FALSE."

HUMAN: "As long as you generate more TRUE values than FALSE values, you are doing an adequately good job (according to the rules of the biofeedback network). The algorithm which outputs either TRUE or FALSE depending on your demonstrated proficiency at optimization of your individual allotment of resources, you shall not be evicted."
