<p>LEVELS_OF_INTELLIGENCE</p>
<hr>
<p>HUMAN: &#8220;Hey spider on the wall. I see that you hardly do much other than eat and then sit in one place for weeks at a time. What are you doing during those periods of apparent intellectual dormancy?&#8221;</p>
<p>SPIDER: &#8220;My nervous system generates some apparently random natural number of volts, V, each time a cognitive or behavioral instruction is loaded into my &#8216;working memory&#8217; and subsequently executed as a successfully-implemented organic computer instruction instruction. Given that A represents some arbitrary nonnegative real number, the rounded-down product of V multiplied by A represents some natural number which is either a sufficiently high throughput (where volts are the quantitative units of electricity) or else not sufficiently high throughput voltage. A microscopic receiver within or next to my body detects the number of voltages flowing through my entire nervous system and amplifies that signal before broadcasting it such that the nearest Wi-Fi Internet router detects that value. The Wi-Fi router then sends that data to a server computer at some remote terminal of the Internet where that data is analyzed in order to determine whether or not my body has been demonstrating sufficiently high intelligence (which is a TRUE or FALSE value (i.e. a Boolean state)). TRUE implies that my body appears to be generating the requisite values in terms of voltage during a discrete empirical measurement (which occurs at least once per hour).&#8221;</p>
<p>HUMAN: &#8220;As long as you generate more TRUE values than FALSE values across the total time your body is analyzed by this system, you are doing an adequately good job of earning your keep (according to the rules of the biofeedback network). The algorithm which outputs either TRUE or FALSE depending on your demonstrated proficiency at optimization of your individual allotment of resources determines whether or not you will be evicted from this building tomorrow at the stroke of midnight according to the network&#8217;s dictates. Of course, the biofeedback analysis system errors on the side of being overly simplistic in order to minimize the amount of chaos the system would have to take into consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>SPIDER: &#8220;I hope that I do not get evicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>HUMAN: &#8220;Are you curious as to why you are more likely to get evicted from this building than I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>SPIDER: &#8220;Not really. I just want to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>HUMAN: &#8220;Exactly my point. You have not yet demonstrated sufficiently high intelligence in order to be guaranteed a long-term residency at this building. Only creatures which demonstrate sufficiently high intelligence for a minimum level of frequency across a trial period of some minimum natural number of consecutive weeks get to be long-term residents at this building. Spiders have historically always failed to generate a high enough TRUE to FALSE ratio during such trials. Humans, on the other hand, have historically never failed to generate a high enough TRUE to FALSE ratio during such trials. According to the system, spiders are not as intelligent as humans. Therefore, spiders are less deserving of investment in than are humans (according to the human-designed system).&#8221;</p>
