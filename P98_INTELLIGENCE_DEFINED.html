"Why Intelligence is More Powerful than Physics...As intelligence saturates the matter and energy available to it, it turns dumb matter into smart matter. Although smart matter still nominally follows the laws of physics, it is so extraordinarily intelligent that it can harness the most subtle aspects of the laws to manipulate matter and energy to its will." - Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology (2005 paperback edition, page 364).

karbytes: "Intelligence is a function whose inputs are raw sensory data (from 'the environment') and reconstituted memorized data (from 'the black box' of 'the (most local) mind') and whose output is the forging of new neuronal circuits which store new information as memories which are physiologically 'hard coded' as three-dimensional neuron configurations (inside 'the central nervous system' which is associated with 'the black box' of 'the (most local) mind')."
