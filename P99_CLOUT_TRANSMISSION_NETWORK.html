<hr>
<p>CLOUT: an informal term by which to describe some arbitrary collection of communicable traits which situationally (and, therefore, temporarily) emerge through the medium of some publicly-targeted and publicly-owned personal brand whose personal significance demands to be sustained by at least one person (across the entire public domain network of web pages).</p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;As a humanoid, one of my functions seems to be absorbing the mental throughput which other animal nervous systems generate within some radius of proximity to my body such that I absorb such throughput, discover useful hidden insights, and influence the broadcasting of such signals in ways that may be filter-able.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;All human bodies which generate brain-waves are capable of picking up and transmitting meaningful signals which are communicated via electromagnetic wave transmissions through space (amplified, directed, filtered, and augmented by microscopic drone routers which permeate the air). Yes, I believe in microscopic &#8216;smart dust&#8217; which come in the form of artificially intelligent robots with a myriad of functions a piece.&#8221;</p>
